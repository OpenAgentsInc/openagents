title: Autopilot Demo + Dogfooding Funnel

## Goal

Ship a public-facing demo of Autopilot that converts visitors into paying customers. The demo shows a real Autopilot run ("Wake up to a PR") and leads directly to checkout. Dogfood the OpenAgents repo to generate authentic demo content.

## Background

From the launch strategy: the single most compelling promise is **"Wake up to a PR"** - a visitor sees a 90-120 second replay of Autopilot autonomously turning an issue into a merged PR, then can immediately sign up.

The demo must be:
- **Real** - Actual Autopilot trajectory, not a mock
- **Fast** - 90-120 seconds to show the full loop
- **Verified** - Show receipts (tests passed, CI green)
- **Value First** - Connect repo → free analysis → then pay

This directive establishes the demo pipeline and the dogfooding loop that feeds it.

## Demo Content Requirements

The demo should show the **complete loop**:

1. **Issue** - Real GitHub issue with description
2. **Claim** - Autopilot posts "I'll take this" comment
3. **Branch** - Creates feature branch
4. **Read** - Explores relevant code
5. **Edit** - Makes the changes
6. **Test** - Runs test suite (green)
7. **Commit** - Clean commit message
8. **PR** - Opens PR with description
9. **CI** - CI passes (shown as receipt)
10. **Merge** - PR gets merged (or: "Ready for review")

Total duration: 90-120 seconds at 2x playback.

## Dogfooding Strategy

Run Autopilot continuously on the OpenAgents repo:

1. **Issue Triage** - Create small, well-scoped issues
2. **Run Autopilot** - Let it claim and work issues
3. **Review PRs** - Human reviews, provides feedback
4. **Promote Winners** - Select best runs for demo

Criteria for demo-worthy runs:
- Clean completion (no crashes)
- Tests passed
- Reasonable duration (<10 min)
- Good narrative arc (problem → solution)
- No embarrassing tool errors

    "ci_status": "passed",
    "files_changed": 3,
    "lines_added": 45,
    "lines_removed": 12
  }
}
```

### Redaction Rules

Before publishing any replay:

1. **Secrets** - API keys, tokens, passwords, private keys
2. **PII** - Full names, emails, phone numbers
3. **Internal Paths** - Replace `/home/user/...` with `/repo/...`
4. **Sensitive Config** - Database URLs, internal hostnames
5. **Proprietary Code** - Only show OpenAgents code (open source)

Redaction is applied at publish time, not during run.

### CDN Structure

```
cdn.openagents.com/
  demos/
    v1/
      replay_abc123/
        manifest.json
        timeline.json.gz
        diffs/
          0001-main.rs.diff
          0002-config.toml.diff
        preview.png
```

## Dependencies

### External
- Stripe - Payment processing
- GitHub OAuth - Repo connection
- CDN - Replay hosting (Cloudflare R2 or similar)

### Internal Directives
- **d-004** (Autopilot) - Runs the demos, produces trajectories
- **d-008** (Marketplace) - Compute for running tests
- **d-009** (Autopilot GUI) - Replay viewer component
- **d-010** (Unified Binary) - CLI for repo connection

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit tests** - Replay parser, redaction, bundle generation
2. **Integration tests** - Full replay → publish → fetch cycle
3. **Visual regression** - Demo looks correct across browsers
4. **E2E tests** - Full funnel: demo → checkout → connect → run
5. **Load tests** - Many concurrent demo viewers

## Security Considerations

### Payments
- PCI compliance via Stripe (never store cards)
- Lightning: verify invoice before confirming payment
- Prevent subscription sharing / abuse

### Replay Content
- All demos manually reviewed before publish
- Automated secret scanning on publish
- No customer data in public demos
- Only OpenAgents repo content

### GitHub Integration
- Minimal permissions (read code, write PRs)
- Token storage in secure keychain
- Revocation on account deletion

## Notes

### The Demo is the Product

The demo isn't a separate marketing asset - it's the exact same experience users will have. Watching the demo teaches users what to expect:

- How Autopilot claims issues
- How it reads and understands code
- How it runs tests
- How PRs look when submitted

This reduces surprise and support burden.

### Dogfooding as Marketing

Every issue Autopilot solves on OpenAgents is potential demo content. This creates a virtuous cycle:

1. Autopilot improves itself (d-004)
2. Improvements create demo-worthy runs (d-027)
3. Demos convert customers
4. Revenue funds more development
5. Return to step 1

### First Impressions Matter

The homepage demo is likely the first contact with OpenAgents. It must:

- Load instantly (pre-render, CDN)
- Look professional (production quality)
- Show real value (actual work done)
- Lead naturally to signup

No "lorem ipsum" - only real, verified work.

## Related Directives

- **d-004** (Autopilot Improvement) - Source of demo content
- **d-008** (Marketplace) - Compute for tests in demos
- **d-009** (Autopilot GUI) - Replay viewer component
- **d-010** (Unified Binary) - CLI install + connect

## Open Questions

1. **Web vs Desktop Demo?**
   → Web for homepage, desktop GUI for paying customers

2. **How often to update demo?**
   → Weekly rotation, keep 3-5 "best of" available

3. **Show pricing before or after demo?**
   → After - let demo sell the value first

4. **Free tier?**
   → TBD - may offer limited free runs for onboarding
