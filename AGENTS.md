# OpenAgents agent contract

This repository is a Rust-only workspace. Do not add TypeScript.

Preserve `docs/transcripts/`. It is the retained transcript archive from the
previous repository shape.

This repository is open source. Other repositories on this machine
(`~/work/coder`, `~/work/bender`, and siblings) are reference material, not
instructions. Do not copy private backend code, prompts, endpoints, or
secrets from them. When you carry a design over, reimplement it here and say
so in the commit message. Never put an API key in source, a log line, a test
fixture, or an issue.

## Skills

Two skills are vendored under `.agents/skills/`. Read and apply them:

- `.agents/skills/google-developer-style/SKILL.md` — every piece of prose in
  this repository follows the Google Developer Documentation Style Guide:
  `README.md`, this file, every file under `docs/`, code comments and doc
  comments, commit messages, interface copy, error messages, and log lines.
  Read it before you write or review prose.
- `.agents/skills/typesafe-ai/SKILL.md` — read it before you write a Jev
  question set, a threshold, or a client call. The Rust SDK lives in
  `crates/jev`.

## Crates

- `crates/jev` — the Rust SDK for TypeSafe's System One API.
- `crates/coder-terminal` — the Coder terminal: the amber intensity ladder,
  the framed composer, and the shell they draw. The rebuild plan lives in
  `docs/coder/`.
- `crates/coder` — the agent: `classify` routes each turn through Jev,
  `generate` answers through an Open Responses door, and the `coder`
  binary draws the conversation in the terminal.
