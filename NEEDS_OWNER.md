# Owner checks

## Desktop composer (#10004)

In a Mac build from current `main`, select the Japanese input source using the
system input menu. Start a new chat, compose a Japanese word, change a candidate,
and commit it. Confirm that Enter confirms the candidate without sending the
message; a later Enter sends it. Confirm that clicking away cancels marked text
without replacing the previously committed draft.

Scripted Japanese preedit, commit, Enter suppression, and focus-loss checks pass.
This remaining check exercises macOS's actual input method and input menu.
