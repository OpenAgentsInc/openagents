# Owner checks

## Desktop composer (#10004)

In a Mac build from current `main`, select the Japanese input source using the
system input menu. Start a new chat, compose a Japanese word, change a candidate,
and commit it. Confirm that Enter confirms the candidate without sending the
message; a later Enter sends it. Confirm that clicking away cancels marked text
without replacing the previously committed draft.

Scripted Japanese preedit, commit, Enter suppression, and focus-loss checks pass.
This remaining check exercises macOS's actual input method and input menu.

## Linux transcript performance (#10005)

On Linux with a native Wayland or X11 session, run the matrix in
`docs/desktop/verification/2026-09-30-transcript/verification.md` and retain the
result directory. Confirm transcript scrolling, tool expansion, and code copy.
The eight Mac cases pass; Linux hardware is unavailable in this worktree.
Open a follow-up issue if the Linux run finds a defect or exceeds 8.3 ms.

## Desktop image input (#10011)

On Linux in a native Wayland or X11 session, attach a generated PNG or JPEG
through **Attach image**, clipboard paste, and file drop. Confirm that each
preview appears, **Remove** preserves the caption, and **Send** preserves the
draft while explaining the current hosted text-only limit. A missing portal or
clipboard facility must report a reason. Repeat image clipboard paste on macOS.
The real macOS picker and scripted decoder, clipboard pixel, drop, removal,
and refusal checks pass. Open a follow-up issue if a native adapter check fails.

## Installed local Coder broker, handoff, and task chat (#10014–#10016)

After installing the desktop bundle and its Coder built from current `main`,
exercise the **Run Coder** flow added by #10015 against this computer. Confirm
that the normal OS key source remains in the resident host, saved device
pairings remain available after restart, and the task can be read and stopped.
With the configured engine signed in, verify live tool steps, Stop, the
phase-appropriate steering choice, queued follow-ups, and answers to a question
and an approval in the same task on desktop and phone. The scratch host checks
cover command admission, durable queue editing, exact retries, steering, Stop,
and archive. Shared state tests cover question and approval answers, stale
responses, split ATIF records, and draft acknowledgment. Native painter checks
cover all three task modes at normal and minimum window sizes.
Archive every verification task afterward. The scratch same-user socket,
portable client, durable inbox, restart, history, admission, and cancellation
checks pass without accessing the owner’s computer state.

## Installed saved sessions (#10017)

After installing a desktop and resident Coder built from current `main`, open
**Saved sessions** and inspect a known Codex session and Claude Code session.
Confirm their titles and times against the original tools. Choose a configured
project and continue one with the engine signed in and the existing auto-start
policy enabled. Confirm that its recent context reaches Coder, tool steps
appear, and the original saved session remains unchanged. Stop and archive
every verification task afterward. Scratch tests cover both source formats,
the native reader, real broker admission, exact prompt bytes, acknowledgment
retries, restart identity, cancellation, and archive without owner state.
