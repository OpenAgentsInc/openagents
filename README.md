# OpenAgents

Cross-platform AI coding assistant built with Tauri. Access the best coding agents through a clean, modern desktop application paired with a mobile app for control on the go.

## True Cross-Platform Development

OpenAgents brings professional AI-powered development to every device. The desktop app provides a powerful, native coding environment while the mobile companion lets you manage tasks, review code, and control your agents from anywhereâ€”with first-class support for voice commands.

## Multi-Agent Architecture

- **Universal Orchestration**: Run Claude Code, Amp, Codex, or local models side-by-side
- **Shared Context**: All agents access the same conversation history and learned patterns  
- **Intelligent Routing**: Automatically selects the best agent for each task
- **Extensible**: Add new agents via standardized interfaces

## Privacy-First Design

- **Local Execution**: Everything runs on your devices
- **Your Data**: Conversations and code never leave your control
- **Optional Sync**: End-to-end encrypted sync between devices
- **Open Protocols**: Built on MCP (Model Context Protocol) and open standards
