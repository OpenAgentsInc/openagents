A native iOS and macOS app for managing your coding agents on the go.

## Why

There is no good mobile app for managing coding agents while AFK.

Coding agent CLIs like Claude Code are powerful enough to handle most day-to-day coding, but developers are still glued to their computers because there's no good way to code on your phone.

Remote terminals are clunky. The labs' bolted-on "Code" features are underpowered afterthoughts.

We want coding agents running async, keeping us just updated enough to nudge them along when needed.

A good agent frees you from your computer, doesn't tie you to it.

## Status

v0.2.5 works as a proof of concept but you should probably wait for our big rewrite in v0.3
