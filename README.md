# OpenAgents: Commander

> Build agents. Sell compute. Earn bitcoin. **(Work in Progress)**

Commander is a desktop app for training AI agents and selling your spare compute for bitcoin.

## Vision

Sell your device's idle compute to the swarm network and get paid in bitcoin straight to your built-in wallet. Train **MechaCoder** through the **GYM** to build agents that leverage the network. Publish to the **Agent Store**.

**Full vision:** [docs/SYNTHESIS.md](docs/SYNTHESIS.md)

## Current State
