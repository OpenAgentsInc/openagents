# Commander

> Build, Train, Deploy, Earn. **(Work in Progress)**

Commander is a desktop app for building autonomous AI agents that earn bitcoin.

## Vision

You command **MechaCoder**, training it through the **GYM** to complete coding tasks. The better you train, the more bitcoin you earn. Publish agents to the **Agent Store** for passive income.

**Full vision:** [docs/SYNTHESIS.md](docs/SYNTHESIS.md)

## Current State

- **MechaCoder** - Autonomous coding agent ([docs/mechacoder/](docs/mechacoder/))
- **FM Hill Climber** - 89.5% on Terminal-Bench regex-log with local Apple FM ([docs/fm-hillclimber.md](docs/fm-hillclimber.md))
- **Effuse** - Effect-native UI framework ([docs/effuse/](docs/effuse/))
