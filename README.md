# OpenAgents: Project Tricoder

A mobile command center for your coding agents.

## Why

There is no good mobile app for managing coding agents while AFK.

Coding agent CLIs like Codex are good enough to handle most day-to-day coding such that devs almost never need to be in the editor.

The only reason we're still glued to our computers most the time is because there's no good way to code on your phone.

Remote terminals are not good enough. The labs' bolted-on "Code" are underpowered afterthoughts.

We want unrestricted Codex running async, keeping us just updated enough to nudge them along when needed.

A good agent frees you from your computer, doesn't tie you to it.
