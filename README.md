## Project FM Hill Climber

FM Hill Climber is our system for solving Terminal-Bench 2 tasks using Apple's on-device Foundation Model with MAP (Modular Agentic Planner) architecture, parallel sampling, and iterative verification. The goal is to achieve #1 on Terminal-Bench using only local inference. See [docs/fm-hillclimber.md](docs/fm-hillclimber.md) for full documentation.
