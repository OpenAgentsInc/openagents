/**
 * Sandboxed preload (#8574) — the ONLY renderer-visible host bridge.
 *
 * Boundary law: no ipcRenderer, no MessagePort/oRPC bridge, no Node or
 * Electron builtins, no filesystem/process authority, no credentials. Static
 * host identity only; the renderer decodes it with Effect Schema. Every
 * future capability crossing this line arrives as a typed, schema-validated
 * service — never a raw channel.
 *
 * CommonJS (.cts -> dist/preload.cjs) because sandboxed preloads cannot be
 * ESM.
