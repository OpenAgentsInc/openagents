title: PostHog Setup - Conclusion
description: Review and fix any errors in the PostHog integration implementation
---

Use the PostHog MCP to create a new dashboard named "Analytics basics" based on the events created here. Make sure to use the exact same event names as implemented in the code. Populate it with up to five insights, with special emphasis on things like conversion funnels, churn events, and other business critical insights. 

Create the file posthog-setup-report.md. It should include a summary of the integration edits, a table with the event names, event descriptions, and files where events were added, along with a list of links for the dashboard and insights created. Follow this format:

<wizard-report>

## Next steps

We've built some insights and a dashboard for you to keep an eye on user behavior, based on the events we just instrumented:

### Agent skill

We've left an agent skill folder in your project. You can use this context for further agent development when using Claude Code. This will help ensure the model provides the most up-to-date approaches for integrating PostHog.

Upon completion, remove .posthog-events.json.
