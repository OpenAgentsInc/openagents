# OpenAgents Component Library

Welcome to the OpenAgents Storybook! This is a living documentation of our UI components built with **Arwes**, **Next.js**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

## ðŸŽ¨ Design System

Our design system is inspired by sci-fi interfaces and built on top of the Arwes framework, featuring:

- **Futuristic UI elements** with animated borders and effects
- **Berkeley Mono** font for consistent typography
- **Cyan and yellow** color palette for a cyberpunk aesthetic
- **Component-driven development** for consistency and reusability

## ðŸ§© Component Categories

### Core Components

### Layout Components
