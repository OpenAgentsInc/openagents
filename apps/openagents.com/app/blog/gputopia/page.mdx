Transcript of episode 174:

Folks I'm excited to announce that this month we are rebooting our swarm compute network, previously called GPUtopia, now called OpenAgents Compute.

Why should you care?

Because you can sell your spare compute for bitcoin - as simple as running a simple desktop app, adding your computer to our global compute marketplace and getting paid in bitcoin.

This is something we already launched. It worked. We paid out I don't know how many tens or hundreds of compute providers. You could provide your compute first through a web application, then through a "workerbee" software that supported inference, finetuning, embedding, image generation, all through an OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

We phased this out. Part of this was, we had a bunch of sellers, not enough buyers. Now this was 18 months ago. And we thought that in the future, the ideal buyer that's going to really help launch this as a two-sided marketplace are going to be agents.

Once agents are good and easy enough to use, that should solve that demand issue.

Eighteen months later, a pivot to OpenAgents later, 170 videos of building a whole bunch of agents infrastructure later, we're ready to bring this back in.

So much has changed in the last 18 months.

We've got great ways of running local models so that we don't need to be building this infrastructure anymore.

We can just pay people for running things like Ollama, focusing on what we're good at.

The thing we'll uniquely provide to this is the super cool interface. You're going to install an app, it's going to be a way for you to see the earnings and visualize the network activity, paired with a cool game-style sci-fi HUD for actually using these agents.

It's going to feel a little bit like a video game, but it's going to have agent payments tied directly into it.

We are going to be building and beta-testing this over the next week or so in our Discord.

Our objective is to take all this stuff we've built so far and put it into one open-source software package.

We're going to continue doing the whole build-in-public thing.

We're going to be beta-testing things still in our Discord, that's been going great.

We want to get the first payments out to sellers of compute a week from today at the latest.

If you want to get a start on that, we're going to be using Ollama as our local model provider. So you'll need Ollama installed locally.

Go [install Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) and then obviously you'll have through OpenAgents the wallet, which works just fine as you can see in our [last video](https://x.com/OpenAgentsInc/status/1922303008617984363).

Stay tuned!
