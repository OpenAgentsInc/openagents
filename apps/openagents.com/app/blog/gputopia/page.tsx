                <p>Transcript of episode 174:</p>

                <p>Folks I'm excited to announce that this month we are rebooting our swarm compute network, previously called GPUtopia, now called OpenAgents Compute.</p>

                <p>Why should you care?</p>

                <p>Because you can sell your spare compute for bitcoin - as simple as running a simple desktop app, adding your computer to our global compute marketplace and getting paid in bitcoin.</p>

                <p>This is something we already launched. It worked. We paid out I don't know how many tens or hundreds of compute providers. You could provide your compute first through a web application, then through a "workerbee" software that supported inference, finetuning, embedding, image generation, all through an OpenAI-compatible endpoint.</p>

                <p>We phased this out. Part of this was, we had a bunch of sellers, not enough buyers. Now this was 18 months ago. And we thought that in the future, the ideal buyer that's going to really help launch this as a two-sided marketplace are going to be agents.</p>

                <p>Once agents are good and easy enough to use, that should solve that demand issue.</p>

                <p>Eighteen months later, a pivot to OpenAgents later, 170 videos of building a whole bunch of agents infrastructure later, we're ready to bring this back in.</p>

                <p>So much has changed in the last 18 months.</p>

                <p>We've got great ways of running local models so that we don't need to be building this infrastructure anymore.</p>

                <p>We can just pay people for running things like Ollama, focusing on what we're good at.</p>

                <p>The thing we'll uniquely provide to this is the super cool interface. You're going to install an app, it's going to be a way for you to see the earnings and visualize the network activity, paired with a cool game-style sci-fi HUD for actually using these agents.</p>

                <p>It's going to feel a little bit like a video game, but it's going to have agent payments tied directly into it.</p>

                <p>We are going to be building and beta-testing this over the next week or so in our Discord.</p>

                <p>Our objective is to take all this stuff we've built so far and put it into one open-source software package.</p>

                <p>We're going to continue doing the whole build-in-public thing.</p>

                <p>We're going to be beta-testing things still in our Discord, that's been going great.</p>

                <p>We want to get the first payments out to sellers of compute a week from today at the latest.</p>

                <p>If you want to get a start on that, we're going to be using Ollama as our local model provider. So you'll need Ollama installed locally.</p>

                <p>Go <a href="https://ollama.com/download">install Ollama</a> and then obviously you'll have through OpenAgents the wallet, which works just fine as you can see in our <a href="https://x.com/OpenAgentsInc/status/1922303008617984363">last video</a>.</p>

                <p>Stay tuned!</p>
