### tl;dr

We just launched a web wallet at [wallet.openagents.com](https://wallet.openagents.com) with support for Bitcoin and Lightning through the new [Spark SDK](https://spark.money).

### Why

We needed an easy way for any person or AI agent to earn and spend bitcoin.

Here's what we wanted from our wallet:

- 100% open-source - both the [wallet](https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/openagents/tree/main/apps/wallet) and [payments infrastructure](https://github.com/buildonspark/spark)
- Self-custodial - no one holds your funds but you
- No login required - only a seed phrase
- Never asks you for sensitive personal information
- No blockchains other than bitcoin
- First-class support for Bitcoin Lightning
- First-class support for bitcoin-native stablecoins
- No fees for payments between OpenAgents wallets

### Help test it

We'll be throwing a few satoshis at a few folks in [our Discord](https://openagents.test/blog/discord) who help test it out and report any bugs.

### How not to use it

As a web wallet connected to various OpenAgents products, this is **not** for long-term storage of your bitcoin stack. This is an experimental hot wallet you should assume is not secure.

Don't load more than a handful of satoshis at a time. When you earn bitcoin to your wallet, please withdraw it regularly to a more established self-custodial wallet. (Try [Zeus](https://zeusln.com/)!)
