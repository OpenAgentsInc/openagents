The docs build emits static agent-readable artifacts without running an AI endpoint or MCP server.

## Available artifacts

- [`llms.txt`](https://openagents.com/docs/llms.txt) indexes the public documentation tree.
- [`llms-full.txt`](https://openagents.com/docs/llms-full.txt) provides the complete public documentation corpus.
- [`agent-readability.json`](https://openagents.com/docs/agent-readability.json) describes enabled static formats and content-use signals.
- Add `.md` to a documentation route to request its raw Markdown mirror.

These artifacts contain only the curated public content under this docs package. They do not index the repository-wide `docs/` directory, internal audits, runbooks, evidence, private traces, or operational topology.

## Authority boundary

Instruction files and documentation help tools understand the system; they do not grant authentication, repository, deployment, payment, moderation, or operator authority. Server-side policy remains authoritative for every action.

Ask AI and hosted MCP are disabled. Search is a local static Orama index built with the site.

## Product claim authority

Product promises are machine-facing evidence, not human website navigation. Agents that need current claim state should read the structured projections directly:

- [`/api/public/product-promises`](https://openagents.com/api/public/product-promises) is the current registry projection.
- [`/api/public/product-promises/transitions`](https://openagents.com/api/public/product-promises/transitions) is the transition receipt stream.
- [`/api/public/product-promises/audit`](https://openagents.com/api/public/product-promises/audit) is the audit projection.

Read the promise identifier, state, evidence, blockers, and caveat together. Documentation, a screenshot, a candidate receipt, or a ProductSpec does not independently make a capability publicly available. `/docs/product-promises` remains a compatibility redirect to this agent-facing boundary.
