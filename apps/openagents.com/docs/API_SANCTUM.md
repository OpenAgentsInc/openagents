# API Auth Note (Rust Control-Service)

This path previously documented legacy Laravel Sanctum usage.

Current active auth/session implementation is the Rust control service under `apps/openagents.com/service/`.

Use these docs instead:

1. `apps/openagents.com/service/README.md`
2. `docs/DEPLOYMENT_RUST_SERVICES.md`
3. `docs/ARCHITECTURE-RUST.md`

Legacy Sanctum material was archived to backroom in OA-RUST-113.
