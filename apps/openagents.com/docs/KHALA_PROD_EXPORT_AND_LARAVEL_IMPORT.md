# Khala Export / Import Note

This path previously documented Khala export into Laravel tables.

Current target architecture is Rust-only service lanes. Use runtime/control migration and replay contracts instead of Laravel import flows.

Canonical references:

Legacy import instructions were archived to backroom in OA-RUST-113.
