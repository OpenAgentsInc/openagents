# Frontend Telemetry (Rust Web Shell)

This path previously documented React/Inertia client instrumentation.

Current frontend is Rust/WASM web shell. Telemetry should be emitted through the Rust shell telemetry adapters and correlated with control/runtime request IDs.

Use current architecture docs:

1. `docs/ARCHITECTURE-RUST.md`
2. `apps/openagents.com/web-shell/README.md`

Legacy React-specific guidance was archived to backroom in OA-RUST-113.
