**Status:** Dormant design horizon and not part of the current MVP. Remote workrooms are not a live feature or an active follow-on.

Earlier OpenAgents work explored controlling coding sessions across Desktop, mobile, owner-managed machines, and managed Agent Computers. Some bounded identity, routing, lifecycle, and evidence contracts landed, but the broader expansion is closed as not planned.

## Four different promises

Remote work often gets compressed into one word, but the roadmap separates four claims:

1. **Synchronized conversation** — more than one client can view consistent durable state.
2. **Remote placement** — work can start on a named, authorized target.
3. **Restart survival** — accepted work survives a process or host restart without silent duplication.
4. **Cross-host movement** — a session can checkpoint, detach, move, and resume with fresh credentials and no split authority.

Proof of one does not prove the others. A mobile UI, remote API, or routed command is not evidence of portable execution.

## Retained safety boundary

If this area is ever reauthorized, targets must remain explicit, owner-controlled and managed targets must follow one lifecycle contract, credentials must use bounded grants, and moves must revoke source authority before minting destination authority. Clients must not silently change provider, custody, account, data posture, or isolation.

Fleet, managed targets, portable sessions, mobile expansion, and voice require a new bounded owner decision and issue before work resumes.

## Historical source trail

The public series includes [mobile sync](https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/openagents/blob/main/docs/transcripts/187.md), [coding agents on a phone](https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/openagents/blob/main/docs/transcripts/193.md), [deterministic Fleet delegation](https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/openagents/blob/main/docs/transcripts/245.md), and the later Desktop-focused episodes on [predictable software](https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/openagents/blob/main/docs/transcripts/248.md) and [sub-agent UI](https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/openagents/blob/main/docs/transcripts/249.md). Only the local-first Desktop workroom belongs to the current MVP.
