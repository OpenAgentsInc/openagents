# Laravel 11

- CRITICAL: ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Laravel documentation and updated code examples.
@if (file_exists(base_path('app/Http/Kernel.php')))
- This project upgraded from Laravel 10 without migrating to the new streamlined Laravel 11 file structure.
- This is perfectly fine and recommended by Laravel. Follow the existing structure from Laravel 10. We do not need to migrate to the Laravel 11 structure unless the user explicitly requests it.

## Laravel 10 Structure
- Middleware typically lives in `app/Http/Middleware/` and service providers in `app/Providers/`.
- There is no `bootstrap/app.php` application configuration in a Laravel 10 structure:
    - Middleware registration is in `app/Http/Kernel.php`
    - Exception handling is in `app/Exceptions/Handler.php`
    - Console commands and schedule registration is in `app/Console/Kernel.php`
    - Rate limits likely exist in `RouteServiceProvider` or `app/Http/Kernel.php`
@else
- Laravel 11 brought a new streamlined file structure which this project now uses.

## Laravel 11 Structure
- In Laravel 11, middleware are no longer registered in `app/Http/Kernel.php`.
- Middleware are configured declaratively in `bootstrap/app.php` using `Application::configure()->withMiddleware()`.
- `bootstrap/app.php` is the file to register middleware, exceptions, and routing files.
- `bootstrap/providers.php` contains application specific service providers.
- No app\Console\Kernel.php - use `bootstrap/app.php` or `routes/console.php` for console configuration.
- Commands auto-register - files in `app/Console/Commands/` are automatically available and do not require manual registration.
@endif

## Database
- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.
- Laravel 11 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models
- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.

## New Artisan Commands
- List Artisan commands using Boost's MCP tool, if available. New commands available in Laravel 11:
    - `{{ $assist->artisanCommand('make:enum') }}`
    - `{{ $assist->artisanCommand('make:class') }}`
    - `{{ $assist->artisanCommand('make:interface') }}`
