# Coder Desktop patches

Keep fork-specific changes here so upstream updates can review each integration.

- [OpenAgents #11836](https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/openagents/issues/11836):
  Add Coder Light and Coder Noir to `zeron-theme`, make them the default light
  and dark selections, and use them when a selected theme is missing. Map the
  public `oa-tokens` palette snapshot in `crates/theme/src/builtins.rs`; no
  sibling checkout is needed. Preserve upstream themes and saved preferences.
  See [the theme system](theme-system.md) for the source revision.
- [OpenAgents D0 (Coder Desktop identity)](../FORK.md#identity-and-branding-seams-patch-log):
  Coder name and icon, `com.openagents.coder.desktop` bundle IDs, own data
  directory, IPC port and `coder-desktop://` scheme, and Zeron's update feed,
  sign-in and edge turned off. Values live in `crates/brand`; the full seam
  list and the platform matrix are in [FORK.md](../FORK.md).
