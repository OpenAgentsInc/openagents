# Create Project Feature Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the "Create Project" functionality for the OpenAgents website, which allows users to create new projects through a modal dialog.

## Overview

The implementation follows the existing pattern in the application, where a button in the header opens a modal dialog that allows users to create a new entity. The modal collects project information, validates it, and submits it to the server via a form action. The server then creates the project in the database and returns a success response.

## Components Created

1. **CreateProject Modal**
   - Path: `/app/components/layout/modals/create-project/index.tsx`
   - Main modal component that contains the form for creating a new project

2. **StatusSelector**
   - Path: `/app/components/layout/modals/create-project/status-selector.tsx`
   - Dropdown for selecting a project status

3. **LeadSelector**
   - Path: `/app/components/layout/modals/create-project/lead-selector.tsx`
   - Dropdown for selecting a project lead

4. **TeamSelector**
   - Path: `/app/components/layout/modals/create-project/team-selector.tsx`
   - Multi-select dropdown for selecting project teams

5. **IconPicker**
   - Path: `/app/components/layout/modals/create-project/icon-picker.tsx`
   - Component for selecting an icon for the project (emojis or Lucide icons)

6. **ColorPicker**
   - Path: `/app/components/layout/modals/create-project/color-picker.tsx`
   - Component for selecting a color for the project

7. **CreateProjectStore**
   - Path: `/app/store/create-project-store.ts`
   - Zustand store for managing the state of the create project modal

## Changes to Existing Files

1. **Projects Route**
   - Path: `/app/routes/projects.tsx`
   - Added action function to handle the project creation form submission
   - Uses the existing createProject function from project-helpers

2. **Header Nav**
   - Path: `/app/components/layout/headers/projects/header-nav.tsx`
   - Connected the "Create project" button to the modal
   - Added the CreateProject component to the header

## Data Flow

1. User clicks the "Create project" button in the header
2. Modal opens with form fields for project information
3. User fills out the form and clicks "Create project"
4. Form data is submitted to the server via the action function
5. Server creates the project in the database
6. On success, the modal closes and the projects list is refreshed

## Features

- **Project Information**: Name, description, icon, color
- **Dates**: Start date and target date
- **Status**: Selection from available project statuses
- **Lead**: Selection from available users
- **Teams**: Multi-select from available teams
- **Create More**: Option to keep the modal open for creating multiple projects

## Integration with Database

The implementation uses the existing `createProject` function from `project-helpers.ts`, which handles the database operations:

1. Creates the project record
2. Associates the project with teams
3. Associates the project with team members

## Future Improvements

1. **User Authentication**: Replace the hardcoded test user ID with the authenticated user
2. **Form Validation**: Add more robust validation for the form fields
3. **Error Handling**: Improve error handling and display
4. **Real-time Updates**: Add WebSocket support for real-time updates
5. **Rich Text Editor**: Add a rich text editor for the description field
