# Create Project Modal Fixes

This document outlines the fixes implemented for the Create Project modal.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Modal Positioning**: Fixed the modal's position being cut off at the top of the screen
2. **Button Functionality**: Ensured the Create Project button correctly opens the modal
3. **User Authentication**: Integrated Better Auth to use the actual authenticated user
4. **Modal Height**: Added max height and scrolling for better usability
5. **Form Resetting**: Fixed the form to properly reset when opened/closed

## Changes Made

### Modal Component (`/app/components/layout/modals/create-project/index.tsx`)

1. **Positioning and Size**:
   - Updated `DialogContent` to use `max-h-[80vh] overflow-y-auto` to ensure modal stays within viewport and scrolls if needed
   - Removed fixed `top-[30%]` that was causing the modal to be cut off

2. **Authentication Integration**:
   - Added `useSession` hook from Better Auth to access the current user
   - Added validation to check if user is authenticated before creating a project
   - Disable the create button if user is not authenticated

3. **Form Reset Logic**:
   - Enhanced the `useEffect` hook to properly reset the form when the modal is opened
   - Added condition to only reset when modal is opened, not closed

4. **Button Handling**:
   - Fixed the onClick handler for the Create Project button

### Project Route (`/app/routes/projects.tsx`)

1. **Authentication in Loader**:
   - Added `auth.api.getSession(request)` to get the current user in the loader
   - Added the user object to the loader's return value

2. **Authentication in Action**:
   - Added authentication check in the action handler
   - Use the authenticated user's ID as the project creator

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Added proper error handling for unauthenticated requests

## Better Auth Integration

The implementation uses Better Auth's client and server APIs:

1. **Server-side**:
   - Uses `auth.api.getSession(request)` to access the current user in loaders and actions
   - Validates user authentication before performing protected actions

2. **Client-side**:
   - Uses `useSession()` hook to get the current user's session
   - Shows appropriate UI based on authentication status
   - Prevents unauthenticated users from creating projects

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. **As Authenticated User**:
   - Log in to the application
   - Navigate to the Projects page
   - Click the "Create project" button
   - Fill out the form and submit
   - Project should be created with your user as the creator

2. **As Unauthenticated User**:
   - Log out of the application
   - Navigate to the Projects page
   - Click the "Create project" button
   - The create button should be disabled
   - If you try to create a project, you'll get an authentication error
