# Archived Elixir Runtime Docs

These documents were moved out of active runtime docs during OA-RUST-099 (`#1808`) when `apps/runtime` scaffolding switched to Rust-only operations.

Archive date: 2026-02-21

Reason:

1. Files referenced retired Elixir/Phoenix runtime code paths (`mix`, `lib/openagents_runtime`, `.exs` tests/migrations).
2. Active runtime operations now use Cargo binaries and Rust deploy jobs only.

Do not use these archived docs for active production/runtime procedures.
