# Implementation Log: Multi-screen Wallet Flow

## Overview
This log documents the implementation of a multi-screen login and wallet creation flow for the OpenAgents wallet application. The implementation follows the instructions in `0846-screens-instructions.md`.

## Components Created
1. **LoginScreen**: Initial entry point with options to create a new wallet or enter a seed phrase
2. **CreateWalletDisclaimerScreen**: Disclaimer screen for new wallet creation
3. **ShowMnemonicScreen**: Displays the generated mnemonic phrase for new wallets
4. **EnterSeedScreen**: Allows users to enter an existing seed phrase to restore a wallet

## App Flow States
Implemented a state-based workflow with the following states:
- `login`: Entry screen
- `creating_disclaimer`: Shows important wallet disclaimer
- `showing_mnemonic`: Displays the generated seed phrase
- `entering_seed`: Interface for entering an existing seed
- `initializing_wallet`: Loading state while connecting to Breez SDK
- `wallet_ready`: Main wallet interface
- `error`: Error display screen

## Major Changes

### App.tsx
- Replaced the original single-screen implementation with a multi-screen flow
- Added state management for different wallet screens
- Modified wallet initialization to support both new wallet creation and restoration
- Added logout functionality
- Enhanced error handling
- Updated formatting to use BigInt for satoshi values
- Implemented persistent wallet storage using localStorage

### UI Components
- Implemented shadcn/ui components for consistent styling
- Created dedicated components for each screen in the wallet flow
- Added proper validation for seed phrases
- Implemented clipboard support for copying mnemonics
- Added warning and disclaimer screens for better user education

### Technical Improvements
- Added proper cleanup for SDK event listeners
- Implemented better state handling with TypeScript types
- Improved error handling and user feedback with toast notifications
- Maintained consistent UI/UX across all screens

## Dependencies
- Used existing shadcn/ui components

## Implementation Notes

- Used the Breez SDK for wallet functionality
- Added proper validation for seed phrases using bip39 library

This implementation creates a complete multi-screen wallet experience with proper security, validation, and user experience considerations.
