# Implementation Log: Spark SDK Integration

## Overview
This log documents the replacement of the Breez SDK with the Spark SDK for wallet initialization, balance fetching, and Lightning invoice generation, while preserving the existing BIP39 mnemonic handling and multi-screen workflow.

## Tasks
1. Update dependencies (Spark SDK was already added)
2. Replace Breez SDK imports with Spark SDK imports in App.tsx
3. Update state management and interfaces
4. Replace initialization, connection, and wallet operations with Spark SDK equivalents
5. Update invoice generation logic
6. Simplify Vite configuration

## Implementation Details

### 1. Dependencies
- Reviewed package.json and found that Spark SDK was already added: `@buildonspark/spark-sdk: "^0.1.14"`
- Kept Breez SDK temporarily to ensure smooth transition (will be removed after testing)

### 2. App.tsx Changes
- Replaced Breez SDK imports with Spark SDK imports
- Updated wallet interfaces to match Spark SDK's data structures
- Implemented SparkWallet initialization using `SparkWallet.create()`
- Updated balance fetching to use Spark's `getBalance()` method
- Replaced invoice generation with Spark's direct `createLightningInvoice()` method
- Updated error handling for Spark SDK specific errors
- Simplified logout process as Spark doesn't require as much cleanup

### 3. Vite Configuration
- Simplified vite.config.ts by removing unnecessary WASM plugins
- Removed Breez-specific optimizeDeps exclusion

### 4. Implementation Challenges
- Spark SDK has different API structure than Breez SDK
  - No direct equivalent for lightning limits/prepare step
  - Different balance data format
  - Different invoice generation approach
- Ensured that QR code generation was preserved
- Maintained consistent error handling

### 5. Store Integration
- Kept existing Zustand store implementation
- Updated wallet state and error handling for Spark SDK

## Testing
- Verified wallet creation workflow 
- Tested wallet restoration from mnemonic phrase
- Confirmed balance retrieval
- Tested invoice generation
- Ensured proper error handling
- Validated QR code display

## Next Steps
- Remove Breez SDK dependency once testing is complete
- Add more Spark SDK features as needed
- Further improve error handling for Spark-specific edge cases
