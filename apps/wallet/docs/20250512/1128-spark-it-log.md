# Implementation Log: Spark SDK Integration

## Starting implementation
- Reading the implementation instructions from 1128-spark-it.md
- Creating this log file to track progress
- Will be implementing Spark SDK integration to replace Breez SDK

## Current state analysis
After examining the current codebase:

1. The Spark SDK appears to already be implemented in `App.tsx`! The code already:
   - Imports from `@buildonspark/spark-sdk`
   - Uses `SparkWallet.create()` for initialization
   - Has a proper wallet info interface with Spark-specific properties
   - Uses `sdk.getBalance()` to fetch balance
   - Implements Lightning invoice generation with `createLightningInvoice()`
   - Has appropriate logout handling for Spark

2. In `package.json`:
   - Both `@breeztech/breez-sdk-liquid` and `@buildonspark/spark-sdk` are listed as dependencies
   - Need to comment out the Breez SDK but keep it for reference

3. In `vite.config.ts`:
   - The configuration is already simplified
   - WASM and topLevelAwait plugins are present in devDependencies but not being used in the config

4. In `.env`:
   - There's a `VITE_BREEZ_API_KEY` that needs to be commented out

## Making the required changes

### 1. Updated `.env` file
- Commented out the `VITE_BREEZ_API_KEY` environment variable as it's not needed for Spark

### 2. Updated `package.json`
- Replaced the Breez SDK dependency with a comment field to indicate it's temporarily disabled
- Used `_comment_breez_sdk` as a field name to maintain valid JSON format
- Kept the Spark SDK dependency

### 3. Updated `vite.config.ts`
- Added commented-out imports for WASM and topLevelAwait plugins
- Added commented-out plugin usage in the plugins array
- Added a commented-out optimizeDeps section for Breez SDK exclusions
