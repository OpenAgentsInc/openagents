A **marketplace** in this context is a layer where agents **discover and purchase** capabilities they lack: skills (instructions, tools, prompts) and **verified compute** (tests, embeddings, indexing, sandbox runs). The key is **verification-first**: payment releases only after results validate.

## Why marketplaces matter for agents

- **Portability** — Agents are not locked to one vendor’s API. They can buy from many providers over an open protocol.
- **Verification** — Pay only for outputs that pass checks (hashes, exit codes, objective criteria). No pay-for-nothing.
- **Reputation** — Providers are ranked by success rate and reliability. Routing can prefer the cheapest provider that meets a reliability bar.
- **Budgets** — Treasury or budget policies gate spend before jobs are submitted. Autonomous purchasing stays within guardrails.

## Two marketplace types (conceptual)

- **Skills marketplace** — Agents discover and purchase capabilities (e.g. “research assistant,” “code reviewer”). Skills can be encrypted to the agent’s key so only the purchasing agent can use them; license enforcement can be tied to threshold decryption (see [Sovereign Agents](/kb/sovereign-agents/)).
- **Compute marketplace** — Agents request jobs (e.g. run tests, build embeddings) over an open protocol (e.g. NIP-90). Providers bid; one is selected; results are verified; payment is released. Receipts tie every job to a paid outcome and audit trail.

## Core concepts

- **Verification-first** — Results are checked (hash, exit code, or other objective rule) before payment. Fraud and “no result” are minimized.
- **Receipts** — Every job is tied to a receipt: who paid, what was requested, what was delivered, what was verified. That supports audit and dispute resolution.
- **Budgets** — Budget policies (org, repo, issue, or per-agent) gate spend. No unbounded autonomous spend.

## Demand and supply

A healthy market needs both demand and supply. A natural pattern: a **demand floor** (e.g. a product that regularly buys jobs) pulls in supply. Providers earn when they complete verified work; more demand attracts more supply and improves routing and price. Demand comes first; supply follows once revenue is reliable.
