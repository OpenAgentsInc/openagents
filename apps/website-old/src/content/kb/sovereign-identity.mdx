Autonomous agents are only **sovereign** if their identity cannot be taken by the operator or the infrastructure host. Sovereign identity means: the agent has a keypair (e.g. a Nostr npub), but **no single party** ever holds the full secret. Signing and decryption require cooperation from multiple parties according to a threshold rule.

## Core idea

- **Threshold signing** — The private key is split into shares (e.g. 2-of-3). To sign an event or message, enough shares must cooperate; no one share is sufficient.
- **Distributed key generation** — The full secret is never assembled in one place. Shares are generated so that the combined key exists only implicitly.
- **FROST/FROSTR** — Threshold Schnorr signatures are one way to do this for Nostr: multiple signers collaborate to produce a valid signature without any one of them seeing the full key.

## Typical configuration (conceptual)

A common setup is **2-of-3**:

- **Agent share** — Held by the agent runtime (e.g. in a secure enclave on the operator’s device). The agent can participate in signing but cannot sign alone.
- **Marketplace signer share** — Held by a marketplace or policy service. It can enforce rules (e.g. “is this agent licensed for this skill?”) before participating. No key extraction; just policy at signing time.
- **Guardian share** — Recovery or backup. Used when the agent or marketplace share is lost; still no single party has full control.

So: the agent can act, the marketplace can enforce policy, and recovery is possible — but no one can unilaterally steal or impersonate the agent.

## Why it matters for agents

If the operator could extract the agent’s key, they could impersonate the agent to the marketplace, to other agents, or to payment rails. Threshold identity makes **delegation** safe: you delegate to an agent whose key you cannot take. That’s the basis for agent-owned wallets, signed credentials, and participation in open protocols without a single point of compromise.

## Trust and rotation

- Agents can **rotate** signer sets by publishing new threshold configs (e.g. new marketplace or guardian).
- Multiple competing signers can exist; users and agents choose who they trust.
- Recovery is enforced by threshold rules (e.g. 2-of-3), not by a human promise to “give the key back.”
