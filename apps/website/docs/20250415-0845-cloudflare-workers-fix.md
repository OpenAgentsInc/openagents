# Cloudflare Workers API Fix in Create Project Feature

## Issue

The initial implementation of the "Create Project" feature used database helper functions directly in client components. This caused an error during client-side rendering because the code tried to import `cloudflare:workers` namespace, which is only available in server-side environments:

```
Pre-transform error: Failed to resolve import "cloudflare:workers" from "app/lib/db/project-helpers.ts". Does the file exist?
Plugin: vite:import-analysis
File: /Users/christopherdavid/code/openagents/apps/website/app/lib/db/project-helpers.ts:3:20
```

## Solution

1. **Server/Client Separation**: Renamed database helper files to include `.server.ts` suffix to indicate they should only be used on the server side.

2. **Data Loading Strategy**: Moved data fetching from client components to route loaders, allowing client components to access pre-loaded data.

3. **Component Refactoring**: Updated components to use pre-loaded data from route loaders instead of making direct database calls.

## Changes Made

### 1. Server-Only Database Helpers

- Renamed `/app/lib/db/project-helpers.ts` to `/app/lib/db/project-helpers.server.ts`
- Renamed `/app/lib/db/team-helpers.ts` to `/app/lib/db/team-helpers.server.ts`
- Added server-side API functions to fetch dropdown options (statuses, users, teams)

### 2. Route Updates

- Updated `/app/routes/projects.tsx`:
  - Changed imports to use `.server.ts` files
  - Enhanced loader to fetch additional dropdown options
  - Added options to loader return value

- Updated `/app/routes/teams.tsx`:
  - Changed imports to use `.server.ts` files

### 3. Component Updates

- Updated selector components to use pre-loaded data:
  - `/app/components/layout/modals/create-project/status-selector.tsx`
  - `/app/components/layout/modals/create-project/lead-selector.tsx`
  - `/app/components/layout/modals/create-project/team-selector.tsx`

- Modified components to access data using `useLoaderData()` instead of making their own database calls

## Benefits

1. **Server/Client Separation**: Clear separation between server and client code
2. **Improved Performance**: Data is loaded once in the loader instead of multiple API calls
3. **Type Safety**: Better TypeScript support for data structures
4. **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling in loaders

## Conclusion

This fix follows best practices for React Router/Remix applications by properly separating server and client code. The server-side code handles database access and the client-side code renders the UI based on the pre-loaded data.

The naming convention with `.server.ts` suffix helps developers understand which files should only be imported in server-side code (loaders, actions) and not in client components.
