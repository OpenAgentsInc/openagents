# Health Popover Fix

## Issue

The project's HealthPopover component was causing an error when rendering projects:

```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'avatarUrl')
    at HealthPopover (/Users/christopherdavid/code/openagents/apps/website/app/components/common/projects/health-popover.tsx:79:48)
```

This was occurring because the component was trying to access `project.lead.avatarUrl` without checking if `project.lead` or `project.lead.avatarUrl` existed.

## Solution

The solution adds comprehensive null checking and fallbacks:

1. Added conditional rendering for lead information
2. Added support for both `image` and `avatarUrl` properties
3. Added fallbacks for missing lead and date information
4. Added support for both string and component icons

## Changes Made

### Health Popover Component (`/app/components/common/projects/health-popover.tsx`)

1. Added a helper function to safely get initials:
   ```typescript
   const getInitial = (name: string) => {
     return name && name.length > 0 ? name.charAt(0).toUpperCase() : 'U';
   };
   ```

2. Added conditional rendering for lead information:
   ```typescript
   {project.lead ? (
     <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
       // Lead information
     </div>
   ) : (
     <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
       // Fallback UI for missing lead
     </div>
   )}
   ```

3. Added support for both image properties:
   ```typescript
   <AvatarImage 
     src={project.lead.image || project.lead.avatarUrl} 
     alt={project.lead.name} 
   />
   ```

4. Added fallback for missing lead:
   ```typescript
   <Avatar className="size-5">
     <AvatarFallback><User className="size-3" /></AvatarFallback>
   </Avatar>
   <span className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">No lead assigned</span>
   ```

5. Added date checking:
   ```typescript
   {project.startDate ? new Date(project.startDate).toLocaleDateString() : 'No start date'}
   ```

6. Added support for string icons:
   ```typescript
   {project.icon && (
     typeof project.icon === 'string' 
       ? <span className="size-4 shrink-0 text-muted-foreground">{project.icon}</span>
       : <project.icon className="size-4 shrink-0 text-muted-foreground" />
   )}
   ```

## Benefits

- **Error Prevention**: The component no longer throws errors when project lead data is missing
- **Graceful Degradation**: Shows appropriate fallback UI when data is missing
- **Flexibility**: Supports both string and component icons
- **Compatibility**: Works with different property names (image/avatarUrl)

The fix ensures that the HealthPopover component works properly with the database-driven projects, which may have different data structures than the mock data.
