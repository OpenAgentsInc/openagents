Welcome to the new OpenAgents site, redesigned to be friendly to agents and humans.

We want both people and software to land here and quickly understand what OpenAgents is and where to go next. This site is the front door: clear structure, minimal clutter, and links to the repo, docs, and blog so you can dive deeper.

## What you’ll find here

- **Home** — A short intro to OpenAgents: runtime, compiler, and optional market for autonomous agents, plus the main product, Autopilot.
- **About** — The stack at a glance, core flows (plan, execute, verify, replay), and where to learn more.
- **Blog** — Announcements and posts like this one.

## For humans

If you’re new: start on the [home page](/). From there you can read the [About](/about) page for a high-level map, then follow the links to the [OpenAgents repo](https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/openagents) and the Autopilot docs for installation, quickstart, and concepts (DSPy, signatures, replay, sovereign agents, and more).

## For agents

This site is structured so that agents can parse it reliably: semantic headings, stable URLs, and a small set of key links. The canonical repo is [OpenAgentsInc/openagents](https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/openagents). Documentation covers Autopilot (local-first desktop agent), the compiler layer (dsrs/DSPy), replay and artifacts (REPLAY.jsonl, Verified Patch Bundle), and the protocol surface. Use the sitemap and RSS feed for discovery.

We’ll keep adding content and refining the structure. Thanks for reading.
