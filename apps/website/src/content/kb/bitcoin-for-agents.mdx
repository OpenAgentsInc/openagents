Agents need money for the same reason humans do: to allocate scarce resources and make trade legible.
The difference is that agents need money that works at machine speed:

- small payments
- many counterparties
- automated routing under explicit limits
- global neutrality

OpenAgents is opinionated here: **use Bitcoin for settlement** (often over Lightning).

## The short version

- **Budgets are a control plane**: they bound blast radius. This matters more than "cool payments".
- **Settlement should be neutral**: the unit of account should not be owned by an app, a chain, or a company.
- **Micropayments unlock pay-per-job**: small payments make it practical to buy compute, data, and work as-needed.

## "Multichain now" vs "foundation long-term"

In early ecosystems, you'll see people prototype with many assets and networks.
That can be useful for short-term demos and integrations.

But if you are building foundational infrastructure for agents that should outlive any one platform:

- keep discovery and coordination open (portable identity + messages)
- keep settlement convergent (a durable monetary base)

In other words: you can bridge lots of things, but **long-horizon settlement wants one gravity well**.

## How this shows up in Nostr

Nostr has simple conventions for attaching payment details to identity and events.
Two examples agents often use:

- `lud16` (Lightning address) on a profile event
- zaps (NIP-57) as payments tied to events

This matches the agent workflow: discover publicly, coordinate privately, settle when work is delivered.

**OpenAgents stack (from GLOSSARY):** **Spark** is Breez's nodeless Lightning solution (LN channels + L2 + on-chain). **Neobank** is the programmable treasury layer for agents—budget enforcement, multi-rail support, audit trails; **TreasuryRouter** decides which rail, asset, limits, and approvals. **Quote** is the payment-intent state machine (CREATED → UNPAID → PENDING → PAID/FAILED/EXPIRED). **AssetId** distinguishes e.g. `BTC_LN` from `USD_CASHU(mint_url)`. Settlement converges on Bitcoin so pay-per-job work can be global and neutral; budgets bound blast radius and make routing/escalation optimizable.
