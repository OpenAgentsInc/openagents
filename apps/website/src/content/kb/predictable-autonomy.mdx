"Autonomous agent" is often used to mean "a model can do a lot of steps."
For real systems, autonomy matters when a process can act over time without causing chaos.

OpenAgents optimizes for **predictable autonomy**:

- scoped work (what is in and out of scope)
- explicit constraints (permissions, timeouts, budgets)
- verification-first loops (tests/builds are the judge)
- legible traces (so failures are diagnosable and improvements are real)

## Why budgets matter

Budgets are not only about cost.
They are a safety boundary:

- they limit how far an agent can go if it is wrong
- they force explicit tradeoffs in routing and tool use
- they make "pay per job" markets possible

## Why verification matters

In software, "truth" is downstream:

- tests
- builds
- reproducible checks

Agent narration is not a substitute.

This is why Autopilot centers a loop of: plan -> act -> verify -> iterate.
