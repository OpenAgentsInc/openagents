"Autonomous agent" is often used to mean "a model can do a lot of steps."
For real systems, autonomy matters when a process can act over time without causing chaos.

OpenAgents optimizes for **predictable autonomy** (Autonomy-as-a-Service): a **contracted outcome over time**, not "AI" or "tokens" alone.

- **Scope**: "Do X"
- **Horizon**: e.g. "over the next 24–48 hours"
- **Constraints**: budget, privacy, repo boundaries, allowed tools
- **Verification**: objective checks (tests pass, PR merged, receipts emitted)
- **Reliability**: known failure modes + escalation ("pause + ask human")

In practice that means: scoped work (what is in and out of scope), explicit constraints (permissions, timeouts, budgets), verification-first loops (tests/builds are the judge), and legible traces so failures are diagnosable and improvements are real. The canonical output of an agent session is the **Verified Patch Bundle**: PR_SUMMARY.md (human-readable), RECEIPT.json (machine-readable), REPLAY.jsonl (replayable event stream). Specs: `crates/dsrs/docs/ARTIFACTS.md` and `REPLAY.md`.

## Why budgets matter

Budgets are not only about cost.
They are a safety boundary:

- they limit how far an agent can go if it is wrong
- they force explicit tradeoffs in routing and tool use
- they make "pay per job" markets possible

## Why verification matters

In software, "truth" is downstream:

- tests
- builds
- reproducible checks

Agent narration is not a substitute.

This is why Autopilot centers a loop of: plan -> act -> verify -> iterate.
