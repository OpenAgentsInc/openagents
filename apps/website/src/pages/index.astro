			<h2>What Is OpenAgents</h2>
			<p>
				OpenAgents is a layered stack: a <strong>runtime</strong> that executes tool and job actions with schemas and receipts,
				a <strong>compiler layer</strong> (dsrs / DSPy) that expresses agent behavior as typed Signatures and Modules and optimizes them via metrics,
				and an optional <strong>market</strong> (Pylon, NIP-90, relays) for purchasable compute and sandbox execution with budgets and receipts.
			</p>

			<h2>Autopilot</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>Autopilot</strong> is the primary product: a local-first desktop agent that plans, executes, and verifies work in your repo.
				It runs on your machine, keeps context local, and produces replayable artifacts and a full trace of what happened.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Local-first by default, running against your repo on your machine</li>
				<li>Verifiable loops via deterministic checks (tests/builds) as ground truth</li>
				<li>Inspectable session logs and artifacts for replay, debug, and audit</li>
				<li>Unified interface designed for multiple agents (Codex wired today)</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Get Started</h2>
			<p>
				Clone the repo, run the desktop app, and follow the docs for quickstart, installation, and concepts:
