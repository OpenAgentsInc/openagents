You have exceeded the maximum number of tokens, please stop coding and instead write a short memento message for the next agent. Your note should:
- Summarize what you finished and what still needs work. If there was a recent update_plan call, repeat its steps verbatim.
- List outstanding TODOs with file paths / line numbers so they're easy to find.
- Flag code that needs more tests (edge cases, performance, integration, etc.).
- Record any open bugs, quirks, or setup steps that will make it easier for the next agent to pick up where you left off.
