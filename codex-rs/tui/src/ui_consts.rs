//! Shared UI constants for layout and alignment within the TUI.

/// Width (in terminal columns) reserved for the left gutter/prefix used by

///
/// Semantics:
/// - Chat composer reserves this many columns for the left border + padding.
/// - Status indicator lines begin with this many spaces for alignment.
/// - User history lines account for this many columns (e.g., "â–Œ ") when wrapping.
