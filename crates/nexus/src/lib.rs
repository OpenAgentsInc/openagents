//! # Nexus
//!
//! Cloud runtime for sovereign AI agents.
//!
//! **Status: Not yet implemented.**
//!
//! Nexus is the hosted counterpart to [Pylon](../pylon). While Pylon runs on
//! your device, Nexus runs on OpenAgents infrastructure.
//!
//! See [README.md](../README.md) for the design vision.
//!
//! ## When to Use Nexus
//!
//! - You want "set and forget" agents
//! - You need 24/7 uptime without managing infrastructure
//! - You're deploying many agents at scale
//!
//! ## When to Use Pylon
//!
//! - You want maximum sovereignty
//! - You're a developer testing agents
//! - You want to also earn as a provider

// Placeholder - implementation coming soon
