//! Streaming normalization of LaTeX math delimiters into the canonical
//! `$...$` / `$$...$$` forms that `pulldown-cmark`'s math extension understands.
//!
//! Models overwhelmingly emit the backslash delimiter forms (`\(...\)`,
//! `\[...\]`) and sometimes `\begin{equation}...\end{equation}`. `pulldown-cmark`
//! only recognizes the `$` forms, so historically the backslash forms were
//! handled by bespoke post-parse source scanners — which were disabled inside
//! table cells (a bug). By rewriting every delimiter form into the
//! canonical `$`/`$$` form *before* parsing, the existing
//! `Event::InlineMath`/`Event::DisplayMath` handlers (which already convert math
//! in both prose and table cells) handle everything uniformly.
//!
//! # Transform set (applied only outside code, respecting escapes)
//!
//! | Input | Output |
//! |-------|--------|
//! | `\( … \)` | `$…$` (whitespace just inside the delimiters trimmed) |
//! | `\)` (unmatched) | `$` |
//! | `\[ … \]` / `$$ … $$` / `\begin{equation} … \end{equation}` | `$$…$$`, interior newlines joined |
//! | `\[` / `\]` (unmatched) | `$$` |
//! | `\begin{equation[*]}` / `\end{equation[*]}` (unmatched) | `$$` |
//!
//! Inline `\( … \)` is converted span-at-once: the matching unescaped `\)` is
//! located and the ASCII whitespace immediately inside the delimiters is
//! trimmed, so the emitted `$…$` has no space right after the opening `$` or
//! before the closing `$`. pulldown-cmark's dollar-math flanking rule rejects
//! `$ … $` (whitespace next to a delimiter) and would otherwise leave a padded
//! span as raw `$ … $` text. Interior newlines join to spaces (TeX treats them
//! as spaces) so a span wrapped across source lines cannot be re-parsed as
//! block structure.
//!
//! # Display spans are joined onto one line
//!
//! Every display-math opener — `\[`, `\begin{equation[*]}`, or a bare `$$` —
//! is resolved span-at-once: the matching close (`\]`, `\end{equation[*]}`, or
//! `$$`, whichever comes first) is located and the span is emitted as
//! `$$…$$` with each interior line trimmed and joined by a single space.
//! CommonMark gives *block* constructs priority over inline math, so a
//! multi-line `$$…$$` whose interior contains a line that looks like a block
//! start — a setext underline (`=`/`-` alone on a line), a `#`
//! heading, or a `-` list item — would otherwise be split into
//! heading/list/paragraph blocks and never reach the math parser. TeX treats
//! interior newlines as spaces, so joining is semantics-preserving (`\\` row
//! separators are untouched and still produce multi-line output downstream).
//!
//! The close-scan is bounded: it gives up (emitting the opener alone, exactly
//! the old behavior) past [`MAX_MATH_SOURCE_LEN`] look-ahead, at a blank line
//! (a paragraph break — two stray `$$` in prose must not fuse across
//! paragraphs), or at a line starting with `>` (blockquoted math carries `>`
//! markers that must not become span content; pulldown already handles the
//! quoted multi-line span after marker stripping).
//!
//! Bare single `$` is left untouched (so the pass is **idempotent**). Escaped
//! openers (`\\(`, `\\[`, `\$`) are left literal via backslash-pair consumption,
//! matching the old scanner's even/odd parity rule. Content inside inline code
//! spans and fenced code blocks is left verbatim (so LaTeX-in-backticks stays
//! raw, preserving prior behavior). Inner LaTeX environments such as
//! `\begin{aligned}` / `\begin{pmatrix}` are *not* touched — they live inside the
//! `$$...$$` span and are rendered by the LaTeX→Unicode converter.
//!
//! # Streaming
//!
//! [`LatexDelimiterNormalizer`] is fed chunks in order and is **chunk-split
//! invariant**: feeding the same total text produces the same output regardless
//! of where the chunk boundaries fall. It achieves this by holding back only a
//! bounded ambiguous suffix (a trailing `\`/`\begin{…` partial, a trailing
//! backtick/tilde run whose length isn't yet known, or an unclosed inline `\(`
//! whose `\)` has not arrived — bounded by the math size cap so an open that
//! never closes cannot stall the stream) until the next chunk, and by flushing
//! that suffix on [`finish`](LatexDelimiterNormalizer::finish).
//!
//! # Known divergences from CommonMark (bounded, documented)
//!
//! - 4-space *indented* code blocks are not treated as code (math inside them
//!   would convert). Rare in model output.
//! - Inline code spans are treated as single-line: an unterminated `` ` `` reverts
//!   to normal at the newline. This only changes behavior next to a stray,
//!   unmatched backtick.
//!
//! Streaming-vs-one-shot equivalence is pinned by an exhaustive byte-split test.
