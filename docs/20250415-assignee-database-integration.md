# Assignee Database Integration

## Overview

This document details the implementation of database-driven Assignees for issues, replacing the previous mock user/member data with real database users.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated issue-helpers.server.ts

- Added `assignee.email` to all issue fetching query SELECT clauses, ensuring complete user data
- Added a new helper function `formatAssignee()` for consistent assignee data formatting  
- Updated all issue transformation code to use the helper function
- Standardized the format of assignee data across all issue-related operations
- Fixed field name inconsistency by using `assignee` (singular) consistently

### 2. Updated AssigneeUser Component

- Modified to work with database user objects instead of mock data
- Removed dependency on mock user status colors  
- Uses dynamic loading of available users from route loader data
- Updated avatar and user display to work with database user format
- Uses route loader data to get the users list

### 3. UI Components Updates

- Updated the issue grid and issue list components to properly handle the new assignee format
- Ensured proper fallback handling when assignees are null
- Fixed field name inconsistency by updating all components to use `issue.assignee` instead of `issue.assignees`

### 4. Store Updates

- Updated Issue interface field from `assignees` to `assignee` for consistency
- Fixed all filter functions and update methods to use the correct field name
- Updated type declarations to use the database format

## Usage Example

The AssigneeUser component now requires a User object with the following structure:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email?: string;
  image?: string | null;
}
```

## Testing

When testing issue creation and assignee selection:
1. Create a new issue and select an assignee from the dropdown
2. The issue should appear in the list with the correct assignee avatar
3. Filtering by assignee should work correctly
4. Updating an issue's assignee should persist correctly
