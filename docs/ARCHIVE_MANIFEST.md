# Docs Archive Manifest

Date: 2026-02-21

## Archive Batches

1. OA-RUST-113 archive batch
- `/Users/christopherdavid/code/backroom/openagents-doc-archive/2026-02-21-oa-rust-113/`

2. Stale-doc cleanup pass
- `/Users/christopherdavid/code/backroom/openagents-doc-archive/2026-02-21-stale-doc-pass-2/`

## Stale-Doc Cleanup Scope (2026-02-21)

Moved from repo docs tree to backroom:

- Historical architecture/history snapshots.
- Audit/report/log/transcript research corpora.
- Legacy autopilot/lightning/local runbooks.
- Superseded plans and archived ADR corpora.
- Legacy protocol subtrees tied to removed stacks.
- Legacy codex planning docs superseded by Rust-era planning.

## Policy

Keep only current Rust-state docs and forward strategy docs in-repo.

If a doc is historical evidence only, move it to backroom.
