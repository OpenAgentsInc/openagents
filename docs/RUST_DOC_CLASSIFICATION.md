# Rust Docs Classification

Date: 2026-02-21

## In-Repo (Authoritative)

1. Canonical architecture and rollout docs under `docs/` root.
2. ADRs under `docs/adr/`.
3. Contract docs under `docs/execution/`, `docs/protocol/`, `docs/dse/`, and `docs/sync/`.
4. Active strategy docs under `docs/plans/active/` and synthesis docs.

## Out-of-Repo (Archived)

Historical/stale docs were moved to backroom and are not canonical for current work:

- `/Users/christopherdavid/code/backroom/openagents-doc-archive/2026-02-21-oa-rust-113/`
- `/Users/christopherdavid/code/backroom/openagents-doc-archive/2026-02-21-stale-doc-pass-2/`

## Rule

In-repo docs must describe either:

1. Current Rust-system behavior and operations, or
2. Explicit forward-looking Rust strategy.
