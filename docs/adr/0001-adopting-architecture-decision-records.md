## 1. Context and Problem Statement

This is a young project, with multiple layers (mobile, web, desktop, bridge). It's a prime opportunity to adopt ADRs - as the project grow and evolves we face challenges:

- Multiple contributors with no established discussion/development community (Discord, Slack)
- Difficultly understanding why decisions were made, rationale, and why other feasible options were rejected (and were they even considered?)
- Risk of inconsistent decision making processes and inconsistent implemnntation
- Knowlege and context is not preserved, agents have to make asumptions

**Why This Matters Now:**
We're at a critical inflection point where the codebase is growing faster than our ability to maintain institutional memory. Each architectural decision compounds the problem - without documentation, we're building on assumptions that may be wrong or outdated.

**Current State:**
- **No centralized communication platform** - discussions happen in scattered GitHub issues, PR comments, and DMs
- **Decision rationale disappears** - commit messages capture "what" but rarely "why" or "why not other options"
- **Inconsistent patterns** - similar problems solved differently across mobile, desktop, and bridge components
- **Knowledge silos** - only the original implementer understands the full context

**Technical Context:**
- **Mobile Layer**: React Native/Expo app with platform-specific constraints and performance requirements
- **Bridge Layer**: Rust WebSocket service managing real-time communication and state synchronization
- **Desktop Layer**: Tauri application with its own architectural decisions
- **Agent Integration**: Complex interaction patterns with various AI coding agents

Without ADRs, we're essentially flying blind and hoping everyone makes consistent decisions. That's not a strategy.

## 2. Decision Drivers

**Immediate Pain Points:**
- **Coordination Overhead**: Every new contributor has to reverse-engineer decisions from code and commit messages
- **Decision Revisiting**: Same architectural questions come up repeatedly because the rationale wasn't documented
- **Inconsistent Implementation**: Different layers solving similar problems in incompatible ways
- **Agent Confusion**: AI agents working on the codebase lack the full context to make informed decisions

**Practical Needs:**
- **Single Source of Truth**: One place to find "why we made this choice" instead of scattered discussions
- **Decision Auditing**: Ability to look back and understand if past decisions are still valid
- **Implementation Consistency**: Clear patterns that can be followed across mobile, desktop, and bridge layers
- **Faster Onboarding**: New contributors shouldn't need to interrogate original implementers

**Future-Proofing:**
- **Scalability**: As the team grows, we can't rely on tribal knowledge
- **Maintenance**: Future maintainers need to understand the reasoning behind architectural choices
- **Evolution**: Architecture needs to evolve intentionally, not accidentally

This isn't about bureaucracy - it's about preventing chaos as we scale.

## 3. Considered Options

### Option 1: Continue Flying Blind (Status Quo)

*   **Description:** Keep doing what we're doing - git commits, code comments, scattered discussions
*   **What this looks like:** Contributors reverse-engineering decisions, asking "why did we do this?" in PRs, making assumptions that may be wrong
*   **Pros:**
    *   Zero upfront overhead
    *   No process to learn or follow
    *   Complete freedom to change direction without documentation updates
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Knowledge attrition is guaranteed** - people leave, forget context, or weren't involved in original decisions
    *   **Decision duplication** - same architectural debates happen repeatedly because nobody remembers the outcome
    *   **Inconsistent implementations** - different layers solve the same problems in incompatible ways
    *   **Onboarding friction** - new contributors waste time understanding architectural choices
    *   **Agent confusion** - AI agents working on the codebase lack crucial context

### Option 2: Enhanced Commit Messages

*   **Description:** Try to be more disciplined about commit messages and code comments
*   **What this looks like:** Longer commit messages explaining reasoning, more inline comments documenting design choices
*   **Pros:**
    *   Uses existing workflow
    *   No new files or processes
    *   Information stays close to the code
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Commit messages get noisy** - mixing "what changed" with "why it changed" makes both harder to read
    *   **No decision framework** - still no structured way to evaluate alternatives
    *   **Hard to discover** - architectural rationale buried in git history
    *   **Limited scope** - commit messages can't capture complex decision processes

### Option 3: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

*   **Description:** Structured, focused documents for architectural decisions
*   **What this looks like:** One document per major decision, with template sections for context, alternatives, and rationale
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Decision clarity** - Forces clear articulation of the problem and considered alternatives
    *   **Historical record** - Complete trace of architectural evolution and the thinking behind decisions
    *   **Reviewable** - ADRs can be reviewed and debated before implementation
    *   **Discoverable** - One place to find all architectural decisions and their rationale
    *   **Consistent process** - Standardized way to evaluate and document architectural choices
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Process overhead** - requires discipline to create and maintain ADRs
    *   **Initial learning curve** - team needs to understand the ADR format and process
    *   **Risk of bureaucracy** - can become a box-ticking exercise if not implemented thoughtfully

## 4. Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** Option 3 - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

**Rationale:**

**We need this now because the current approach is already failing.** The project is growing faster than our ability to maintain context, and we're starting to see the symptoms:

1. **Decision fatigue** - Same questions coming up repeatedly because nobody remembers previous discussions
2. **Implementation drift** - Similar problems being solved differently across components
3. **Onboarding friction** - New contributors wasting time understanding architectural choices
4. **Agent confusion** - AI agents lacking the context to make informed decisions

**Why ADRs specifically:**

**Structure without bureaucracy:** ADRs force clear thinking about alternatives and consequences without becoming overly process-heavy. Each ADR is focused on one decision, making them manageable.

**Future-proofing:** As the project scales beyond the original contributors, we need a way to transfer architectural knowledge that doesn't rely on tribal memory or oral history.

**Decision quality:** The ADR template forces consideration of alternatives and consequences, leading to better decisions than gut reactions or "first good enough solution" approaches.

**Low barrier to entry:** The process is lightweight enough that it won't significantly slow down development, yet structured enough to capture the essential reasoning.

**Practical reality:** We're already paying the cost of poor architectural documentation in coordination overhead, rework, and confusion. ADRs formalize a process that should already be happening informally.

This isn't about adopting "best practices" for their own sake. It's about solving a real problem that's already causing friction and will only get worse as we scale.

## 5. Consequences

### What We Get (The Good Stuff)

- **No more reverse-engineering decisions** - New contributors can read the ADR instead of interrogating original implementers
- **Better decisions through forced thinking** - The ADR template makes us consider alternatives instead of jumping to first solution
- **Architectural memory** - We won't have the same debates repeatedly because nobody remembers the outcome
- **Implementation consistency** - Clear patterns that can be followed across mobile, desktop, and bridge layers
- **Context for AI agents** - Better architectural understanding leads to more informed AI assistance
- **Accountability** - Decisions are documented with names and dates, not made anonymously

### What It Costs (The Real Trade-offs)

- **Process friction** - Every significant architectural decision now requires documentation
- **Time investment** - Writing good ADRs takes time that could be spent coding
- **Discipline required** - We have to actually maintain this, not just start and abandon it
- **Over-documentation risk** - Temptation to ADR every minor decision instead of focusing on significant ones
- **Maintenance burden** - ADRs may need updates as architecture evolves

### What Changes (The Cultural Impact)

- **More explicit decision-making** - We'll have to articulate our reasoning instead of "just because"
- **Slower initial decisions** - But hopefully better long-term outcomes
- **Shared understanding** - Everyone can see the architectural reasoning, not just core contributors
- **Historical transparency** - Future contributors can understand why we made the choices we did

**Bottom line:** This adds overhead, but we're already paying the cost of poor architectural documentation in confusion and rework. ADRs just make that cost explicit and visible.

## 6. Validation Plan

**How we'll know if this actually works:**

1. **Real-world usage** - Create ADRs for the next 3-5 significant architectural decisions and see if the process holds up
2. **Reference patterns** - Track whether ADRs are actually being referenced in discussions, PRs, and decision-making
3. **Onboarding feedback** - Ask new contributors if ADRs help them understand architectural choices
4. **Decision duplication test** - See if we have fewer repeated architectural debates

**Success indicators (the "does this actually help?" test):**
- Contributors can find architectural reasoning without asking original implementers
- PR discussions reference ADRs instead of re-debating settled decisions
- New contributors spend less time understanding "why we did it this way"
- AI agents demonstrate better understanding of architectural constraints

**Failure indicators (time to reconsider):**
- ADRs become perfunctory box-ticking exercises
- Team bypasses the process because it's too cumbersome
- ADRs aren't actually being read or referenced
- Process slows down development without meaningful benefits

**Timeline:** Re-evaluate after 3 months and 10 ADRs. If this isn't providing real value, we'll adjust or abandon the approach.
