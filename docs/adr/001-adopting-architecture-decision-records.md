## 1. Context and Problem Statement

OpenAgents is a mobile-first architecture with multiple layers: an Expo React Native app, a Rust WebSocket bridge service, and integration with AI coding agents. As the project grows and evolves, we face several challenges:

**Current Challenges:**
- No systematic way to document architectural decisions
- Difficulty understanding why certain design choices were made
- Inconsistent decision-making processes across mobile and backend components
- New contributors struggle to understand architectural rationale
- Historical knowledge is lost when team members leave or forget context

**Specific Context:**
- **Mobile Constraints**: React Native/Expo framework limitations, iOS/Android platform requirements, performance constraints on mobile devices
- **Bridge Architecture**: Rust WebSocket server managing real-time communication between mobile app and AI agents
- **Agent Integration**: Complex interaction patterns with various AI coding agents
- **Cross-Platform Development**: iOS and Android specific considerations
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket-based architecture requiring careful design decisions

## 2. Decision Drivers

- **Knowledge Preservation**: Need to maintain institutional knowledge as the project scales
- **Team Collaboration**: Enable better decision-making discussions and reviews
- **Mobile Development Complexity**: Document platform-specific constraints and solutions
- **Bridge Service Design**: Record critical decisions about WebSocket communication patterns
- **Onboarding Efficiency**: Help new contributors understand architectural choices quickly
- **Consistency**: Standardize how we evaluate and document architectural decisions
- **Change Management**: Track evolution of the architecture over time
- **Technical Debt Management**: Document trade-offs and consequences of architectural choices

## 3. Considered Options

### Option 1: No Formal Documentation (Status Quo)

*   **Description:** Continue relying on git commit messages, code comments, and informal discussions
*   **Pros:**
    *   No overhead of maintaining additional documentation
    *   Flexibility to change direction without formal process
    *   Less initial effort required
*   **Cons:**
    *   Knowledge loss over time
    *   Difficulty explaining architectural decisions to new team members
    *   Inconsistent decision-making processes
    *   No structured way to review architectural decisions
    *   Historical context becomes scattered across multiple sources

### Option 2: General Technical Documentation

*   **Description:** Create general technical documentation and architectural overviews
*   **Pros:**
    *   Better than no documentation
    *   Can cover broad architectural topics
    *   Familiar approach for most developers
*   **Cons:**
    *   Lacks focus on specific decisions and their rationale
    *   Can become outdated quickly
    *   Doesn't capture the decision-making process
    *   Hard to trace why specific choices were made

### Option 3: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

*   **Description:** Adopt a structured ADR process similar to established patterns used by successful projects
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Focused Documentation**: Each ADR captures one specific decision with full context
    *   **Structured Process**: Clear template and lifecycle for decision-making
    *   **Historical Trace**: Complete record of architectural evolution
    *   **Collaborative Review**: Built-in review process for architectural decisions
    *   **Mobile-Aware**: Can document platform-specific constraints and solutions
    *   **Bridge Architecture Focus**: Can capture WebSocket and real-time communication decisions
    *   **Industry Standard**: Proven approach used by many successful projects
    *   **Low Overhead**: Lightweight process that doesn't slow down development
*   **Cons:**
    *   Initial setup and learning curve
    *   Requires discipline to maintain
    *   May seem like additional process overhead

### Option 4: Hybrid Approach (Documentation + ADRs)

*   **Description:** Combine general architectural documentation with focused ADRs for major decisions
*   **Pros:**
    *   Comprehensive coverage of both high-level architecture and specific decisions
    *   Flexibility to document at appropriate levels of detail
    *   Can reference ADRs from general documentation
*   **Cons:**
    *   More complex to maintain
    *   Risk of duplication or inconsistency between documentation types
    *   Higher maintenance overhead

## 4. Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** Option 3 - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

**Rationale:**

1. **Project Complexity Fit**: OpenAgents has a unique mobile-first architecture with cross-platform concerns that benefits greatly from structured decision documentation

2. **Mobile Development Needs**: Platform-specific constraints (iOS/Android), Expo framework limitations, and performance considerations need systematic documentation

3. **Bridge Architecture Criticality**: The WebSocket bridge service is a critical component where architectural decisions have significant impact on reliability and performance

4. **Agent Integration Evolution**: As we integrate with different AI coding agents, documenting architectural decisions becomes crucial for maintaining consistency

5. **Team Scaling**: As the project grows, ADRs will help onboard new contributors and maintain architectural coherence

6. **Low Overhead**: The ADR process is lightweight and can be integrated into existing development workflows without significant friction

7. **Proven Approach**: ADRs are successfully used by many projects and provide a structured yet flexible approach to architectural documentation

## 5. Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **Improved Knowledge Sharing**: Team members can easily understand why architectural decisions were made
- **Better Decision Quality**: Structured evaluation of alternatives leads to more thoughtful decisions
- **Enhanced Onboarding**: New contributors can quickly get up to speed on architectural choices
- **Mobile Architecture Clarity**: Platform-specific decisions and constraints are properly documented
- **Bridge Design Documentation**: Critical WebSocket and real-time communication decisions are preserved
- **Change Management**: Clear record of architectural evolution over time
- **Reduced Technical Debt**: Better visibility into trade-offs and consequences of decisions
- **Collaborative Culture**: Encourages team discussion and review of architectural decisions

### Negative Consequences

- **Initial Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn the ADR process and templates
- **Documentation Overhead**: Requires time to create and maintain ADRs
- **Process Discipline**: Must maintain consistency in ADR creation and updates
- **Potential for Bureaucracy**: Risk of over-processing minor architectural decisions

### Neutral Consequences

- **Cultural Shift**: Moving toward more explicit architectural deliberation
- **Documentation Maintenance**: Need to keep ADRs updated as architecture evolves
- **Tooling Requirements**: May need simple scripts or tooling to manage ADR numbering and workflow

## 6. Validation Plan

1. **Pilot Implementation**: Start with this ADR and 2-3 initial architectural decisions
2. **Team Feedback**: Gather feedback after 3 months on the ADR process effectiveness
3. **Integration Review**: Evaluate how well ADRs integrate with existing development workflows
4. **Usage Metrics**: Track ADR creation frequency and reference patterns in discussions
5. **Onboarding Assessment**: Measure effectiveness of ADRs in helping new contributors understand architecture
6. **Mobile-Specific Validation**: Ensure ADRs adequately capture mobile development concerns and constraints
7. **Bridge Architecture Coverage**: Verify that critical WebSocket and communication decisions are properly documented
