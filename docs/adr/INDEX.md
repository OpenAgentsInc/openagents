# ADR Index (Rust-Era Reset)

Status: reset in progress (OA-RUST-004 complete, OA-RUST-005 follows)
Last updated: 2026-02-21

## Active ADR Set

No active Rust-era ADRs have been reissued in this directory yet.

`OA-RUST-005` reinitializes numbering and publishes the new active ADR index.

## Legacy ADR Archive

The pre-reset ADR corpus was archived on 2026-02-21 to:

- `docs/plans/archived/adr-legacy-2026-02-21/`
- Legacy index snapshot: `docs/plans/archived/adr-legacy-2026-02-21/INDEX.md`
- Legacy process/readme snapshot: `docs/plans/archived/adr-legacy-2026-02-21/README.md`

Use the archive for historical context only; it is not the active authority for Rust-era architecture decisions.

## Next Action

- Complete `OA-RUST-005` to publish new Rust-era ADR-0001+ records and update this index.
