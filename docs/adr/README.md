# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory is the active ADR namespace for the Rust-era architecture set.

## Current State

- Legacy ADR corpus has been archived (OA-RUST-004).
- New Rust-era ADR set is not yet populated in this directory.
- `OA-RUST-005` will initialize the new numbering/index and templates for active decisions.

## Legacy Archive

Archived ADR corpus path:

- `docs/plans/archived/adr-legacy-2026-02-21/`

Treat archived ADRs as historical context only.

## Authority Note

Until the new ADR set is published, use:

1. `docs/ARCHITECTURE-RUST.md` for target architecture invariants.
2. `docs/plans/active/rust-migration-invariant-gates.md` for migration gate enforcement.
3. `docs/plans/active/rust-migration-execution-control-plane.md` for execution/ownership rules.
