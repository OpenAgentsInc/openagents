# APM (Actions Per Minute) System

This document explains the comprehensive APM analysis system in OpenAgents, including the different types of APM measurements, their implications, and how to interpret the data.

## What is APM?

APM (Actions Per Minute) is a productivity metric borrowed from competitive gaming (specifically StarCraft) that measures the frequency of meaningful actions a user performs. In the context of Claude Code, an "action" includes:

- **Messages**: Both user queries and assistant responses
- **Tool Uses**: When Claude uses tools like Edit, Read, Bash, etc.

## Types of APM Measurements

The system provides **four distinct APM calculations** to give different perspectives on productivity:

### 1. Session APM
**Formula**: `(Total Messages + Total Tool Uses) / Total Session Duration`

**What it measures**: Your average APM when you're actively coding

**Example Calculation**:
- 3 sessions: 10 min, 15 min, 5 min = 30 minutes total
- 114 total actions across all sessions
- **Session APM**: 114 ÷ 30 = **3.8 APM**

**Use Case**: Understanding your productivity during focused work periods

### 2. All-Time APM  
**Formula**: `(Total Messages + Total Tool Uses) / Calendar Time from First to Last Conversation`

**What it measures**: Your APM across your entire Claude Code usage history, including breaks

**Example Calculation**:
- Same 114 actions and 30 minutes of active time
- Sessions spread over 2 days = 2,880 minutes calendar time
- **All-Time APM**: 114 ÷ 2,880 = **0.04 APM**

**Use Case**: Understanding overall engagement and usage patterns

### 3. Last 24 Hours APM
**Formula**: `(Actions in Last 24 Hours) / 1440 minutes`

**What it measures**: Your APM over the past 24 hours of calendar time

**Example Calculation**:
- 25 actions in the last 24 hours
- **Last 24 Hours APM**: 25 ÷ 1440 = **0.017 APM**

**Use Case**: Recent productivity regardless of active session time

### 4. Current Session APM
**Formula**: APM of your most recent active session

**What it measures**: How productive your latest coding session was

**Use Case**: Real-time feedback on current performance

## Understanding the Numbers

### Real-World Context

Based on analysis of 279 real Claude Code conversations:
- **Session APM Average**: 3.8 actions/minute during active coding
- **Peak Session**: 1,215 APM recorded
- **Tool Distribution**: Bash (34%), Read (23%), Edit (21%)

### APM Comparison Examples

**High Session APM (50+ APM)**:
- Rapid iteration cycles, efficient workflows
- Bug fixing sessions, rapid prototyping
- Flow state coding

**Moderate Session APM (10-50 APM)**:
- Balanced development work
- Feature implementation with research
- Normal debugging workflows

**Low Session APM (0-10 APM)**:
- Learning and exploration phases
- Code reading and understanding
- Research-heavy tasks

### APM Comparison: Different Time Perspectives

The four APM metrics provide different views of productivity:

```
Session APM = Actions / Active Coding Time Only
All-Time APM = Actions / (Total Calendar Time Since First Use)
Last 24 Hours APM = Actions in Last 24h / 1440 minutes
Current Session APM = Actions / Most Recent Session Duration
```

**Example Comparison**:
- Developer: 114 actions total, 30 minutes active coding, over 2 days, with 25 actions in last 24h
- **Session APM**: 114 ÷ 30 = **3.8 APM** (active productivity)
- **All-Time APM**: 114 ÷ 2,880 = **0.04 APM** (long-term engagement)
- **Last 24 Hours APM**: 25 ÷ 1,440 = **0.017 APM** (recent activity)
- **Current Session APM**: Varies by latest session

## What Actions Are Counted?

### Messages
- **User Messages**: Questions, requests, code reviews
- **Assistant Messages**: Explanations, responses, guidance

### Tool Uses (Assistant Only)
Extracted from assistant message content arrays:

```json
{
  "type": "tool_use",
  "name": "Edit",
  "input": {
    "file_path": "src/app.js",
    "old_string": "const port = 3000",
    "new_string": "const port = process.env.PORT || 3000"
  }
}
```

### Tool Categories

| Category | Tools | Typical APM Impact |
|----------|-------|-------------------|
| **Code Generation** | Edit, MultiEdit, Write | High - direct productivity |
| **File Operations** | Read, LS, Glob | Medium - exploration/understanding |
| **System Operations** | Bash | High - automation and execution |
| **Search** | Grep, WebSearch, WebFetch | Medium - research and discovery |
| **Planning** | TodoWrite, TodoRead | Low - organization |

## Session Boundaries and Duration

### How Sessions Are Defined
- **Session ID**: Unique identifier from Claude Code
- **Start Time**: Timestamp of first message in session
- **End Time**: Timestamp of last message in session
- **Duration**: `End Time - Start Time` (not cumulative thinking time)

### What's NOT Counted
- Time spent thinking between messages
- Time reading without responding
- Breaks within a session
- Time spent outside Claude Code

### Minimum Session Requirements
- At least 2 messages (user + assistant)
- Duration > 0 minutes
- Valid timestamps

## Interpreting Your APM

**Indicates**:
- Rapid iteration cycles
- Efficient tool usage
- Flow state coding
- Well-optimized workflows

**Common Scenarios**:
- Bug fixing sessions
- Rapid prototyping
- Automated refactoring
- Emergency debugging

### Low Session APM (0-10 APM)
**Indicates**:
- Learning and exploration
- Complex problem analysis
- Reading and understanding code
- Research-heavy tasks

**Common Scenarios**:
- Onboarding to new codebase
- Architecture planning
- Learning new technologies
- Code review and analysis

### Moderate Session APM (10-50 APM)

- Normal debugging workflows
- Mixed activities

## Productivity Insights

### Time-Based Analysis
Sessions are categorized by start time:

- **Morning (6-12)**: Often highest focus and APM
- **Afternoon (12-18)**: Consistent productivity
- **Evening (18-24)**: Variable, depends on energy
- **Night (0-6)**: Usually debugging or urgent fixes

### Tool Usage Patterns

**Bash-Heavy Sessions** (High System APM):
- Deployment and DevOps tasks
- Build system debugging
- Environment setup
- Automation workflows

**Read-Heavy Sessions** (High Exploration APM):
- Code archaeology and understanding
- Learning new codebases
- Research and investigation
- Documentation review

**Edit-Heavy Sessions** (High Implementation APM):
- Feature development
- Bug fixing
- Refactoring
- Code generation

## Performance Optimization Tips

### To Increase Session APM:
1. **Use keyboard shortcuts** for common operations
2. **Batch similar operations** (multiple edits in sequence)
3. **Leverage automation tools** (Bash scripts, bulk operations)
4. **Minimize context switching** between different tasks
5. **Use tool chains** (Read → Edit → Bash → Test cycles)

### To Improve Code Quality (Balance APM):
1. **Don't optimize APM at expense of quality**
2. **Use Read commands** before making changes
3. **Take time for architecture decisions**
4. **Review and test changes**
5. **Document complex solutions**

## Data Sources and Accuracy

### File Locations
```
~/.claude/projects/*/
├── session-id-1.jsonl
├── session-id-2.jsonl
└── ...
```

### Parsing Methodology
1. **Scan all project directories** under `~/.claude/projects/`
2. **Parse JSONL files** line by line
3. **Group by session ID** from conversation entries
4. **Extract timestamps** and calculate durations
5. **Count messages and tool uses** per session
6. **Aggregate statistics** across all sessions

### Limitations and Considerations

**Network Delays**:
- Tool execution time may vary based on connection
- Doesn't affect action counting, only timing

**Session Boundaries**:
- Some logical work may span multiple sessions
- Manual session management by user

**Context Complexity**:
- Simple edits vs complex architecture decisions
- APM doesn't measure code quality or impact

**Interruptions**:
- Real-world workflow disruptions
- Multitasking between projects

## Conclusion

APM analysis provides data-driven insights into coding productivity patterns. The dual measurement system (Session APM vs All-Time APM) offers both focused and holistic views of development activity.

**Session APM** shows your effectiveness during active work periods, while **All-Time APM** reflects overall engagement patterns. Both metrics together provide a comprehensive understanding of your development workflow and productivity trends.

Remember: APM is a tool for insight, not optimization at the expense of code quality. The goal is sustainable, effective development practices informed by data.
