## **I. Introduction**

The **Agent Trajectory Interchange Format (ATIF)** is a standardized, JSON-based specification for logging the complete interaction history of autonomous LLM agents. ATIF is designed to unify the distinct data requirements of conversational logs, explicit action sequences (MiniSweAgent[^1]), and replayable data structures (OpenHands), ensuring collected data is immediately usable across debugging, visualization, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) pipelines.

This format will serve as the standardized data logging methodology for the Harbor project.

### **Trajectory Definition**

For the purpose of ATIF, a trajectory is defined as a sequence of interactions between a user and an agent, including the agent's internal reasoning, actions, and observations. The trajectory captures the complete interaction history, including all user messages (initial and subsequent), agent responses, tool executions, and environment feedback. This design supports both single-turn tasks and multi-turn conversational interactions.

### **Version History**

**v1.4 (Current)**

- Added optional `prompt_token_ids` field to `MetricsSchema` for storing prompt token IDs
- `prompt_token_ids` contains the actual tokens sent to the LLM in that turn, including previous chat history if applicable

**v1.3**

- Added optional `completion_token_ids` field to `MetricsSchema` for storing completion token IDs
- Token IDs enable accurate reinforcement learning training by avoiding retokenization drift

**v1.2**

- Extended `observation` field to support system steps for tracking system-initiated operations
- System steps can now include observations for events such as subagent delegation, context management, environment resets, or checkpoint creation
- Clarified that `prompt_tokens` includes ALL input tokens (both cached and non-cached), with `cached_tokens` tracking the subset that were cache hits

**v1.1**

- Added optional `extra` field at root level for custom metadata not covered by the core schema

**v1.0**

- Initial specification release

| cached_tokens        | Integer | Optional | Subset of `prompt_tokens` that were cache hits from prompt caching (e.g., a prefix or history cache). This counts tokens that were reused from cache rather than reprocessed. **This is included in the `prompt_tokens` count**, not separate from it.                                   |
| cost_usd             | Float   | Optional | Monetary cost of the API call based on current provider pricing for this step.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| prompt_token_ids     | Array   | Optional | Array of integer token IDs for the prompt (input) tokens sent to the LLM in this step, including previous chat history if applicable. Enables accurate analysis and debugging of prompt tokenization. Length should match `prompt_tokens` count.                                         |
| completion_token_ids | Array   | Optional | Array of integer token IDs for the completion (response) tokens generated in this step. Enables accurate RL training by avoiding retokenization drift. Should align with `logprobs` array if both are present. Length should match `completion_tokens` count.                            |
| logprobs             | Array   | Optional | Array of log probabilities for each completion token.[^7] Should align with `completion_token_ids` array if both are present. Length should match `completion_tokens` count.                                                                                                             |
| extra                | Object  | Optional | Object for provider-specific or experimental metrics not covered by the core schema (e.g., reasoning_tokens, cache_creation_input_tokens).                                                                                                                                               |

**Token Accounting and Cost Calculation:**

ATIF defines `prompt_tokens` as the total count of all input tokens (both cached and non-cached), with `cached_tokens` tracking the subset that were cache hits. This provides a complete view of prompt size while also tracking cache efficiency.

To calculate the total cost for a step:

```
non_cached_prompt_tokens = prompt_tokens - cached_tokens
cost_usd = (non_cached_prompt_tokens × cost_per_input_token) +
           (cached_tokens × cost_per_cached_token) +
           (completion_tokens × cost_per_completion_token)
```

Similarly, for trajectory-level costs in `final_metrics`:

```
non_cached_total = total_prompt_tokens - total_cached_tokens
total_cost_usd = (non_cached_total × cost_per_input_token) +
                 (total_cached_tokens × cost_per_cached_token) +
                 (total_completion_tokens × cost_per_completion_token)
```

Where:

- `total_prompt_tokens` = sum of all `prompt_tokens` across steps (includes all input tokens, both cached and non-cached)
- `total_cached_tokens` = sum of all `cached_tokens` across steps (subset of total_prompt_tokens)
- `total_completion_tokens` = sum of all `completion_tokens` across steps

Note that ATIF does not record per-token pricing information because:

1. Pricing can change over time, making historical trajectories inaccurate
2. Most agent frameworks don't record pricing, requiring a lookup table for conversion
3. Pricing varies by provider, tier, and region

The `cost_usd` and `total_cost_usd` fields store the calculated cost at the time of execution, providing a snapshot without coupling the format to specific pricing models.

**Important Note on Additional Cost Factors:**

Some LLM providers charge for additional factors beyond the standard token types. For example, Anthropic charges separately for `cache_creation_input_tokens` when new prompt cache entries are created. These additional cost factors should be recorded in the `extra` field within the `metrics` object.

When such additional cost factors exist, the simplified cost formula above may not accurately represent the actual cost. In these cases:

1. Record the **actual cost** in the `cost_usd` field if available from the provider
2. Store additional token metrics (e.g., `cache_creation_input_tokens`) in `metrics.extra`
3. The presence of values in `metrics.extra` signals that the standard formula may be incomplete

This approach ensures that actual costs are preserved accurately while maintaining the flexibility to accommodate provider-specific pricing models.

### **ObservationSchema**

The _observation_ object records results from the environment or system events. For agent steps, results may stem from structured _tool_calls_, agent actions that don't use standard tool calling mechanisms, or subagent delegation. For system steps, observations may contain results from system-initiated operations such as subagent delegation, context management, environment resets, checkpoint creation, or other infrastructure-level events.

| Field   | Type  | Status   | Description                                                                          |
| :------ | :---- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| results | Array | Required | Array of result objects, each containing feedback from a single tool call or action. |

#### **ObservationResultSchema**

Each element in the _results_ array follows this schema:

| Field                   | Type   | Status   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :---------------------- | :----- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| source_call_id          | String | Optional | The `tool_call_id` from the _tool_calls_ array in _StepObject_ that this result corresponds to. If null or omitted, the result comes from an action that doesn't use the standard tool calling format (e.g., agent actions without tool calls or system-initiated operations). |
| content                 | String | Optional | The textual output or result from the tool execution or action. May be omitted when `subagent_trajectory_ref` is present.                                                                                    |
| subagent_trajectory_ref | Array  | Optional | Array of references to delegated subagent trajectories. Each element follows _SubagentTrajectoryRefSchema_. Use a singleton array for a single subagent.                                                     |

Example:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "source_call_id": "call_price_1",
      "content": "GOOGL is currently trading at $185.35"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### **SubagentTrajectoryRefSchema**

For multi-agent systems or hierarchical agent architectures, an observation result may reference a complete subagent trajectory. This enables tracking of recursive or delegated agent workflows where a parent agent spawns subagents to handle specific subtasks.

| Field           | Type   | Status   | Description                                                                                                |
| :-------------- | :----- | :------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| session_id      | String | Required | The session ID of the delegated subagent trajectory.                                                       |
| trajectory_path | String | Optional | A reference to the complete subagent trajectory file (e.g., file path, S3 URL, or database reference).     |
| extra           | Object | Optional | Object for custom metadata about the subagent execution (e.g., summary, exit status, performance metrics). |

Example:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "source_call_id": "call_delegate_1",
      "subagent_trajectory_ref": [
        {
          "session_id": "subagent-ABC123",
          "trajectory_path": "s3://trajectories/subagent-ABC123.json",
          "extra": {}
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

When _subagent_trajectory_ref_ is present, the `content` field may be omitted, as the complete trajectory provides full detail. Alternatively, `content` may contain a simplified summary for quick reference without loading the full subagent trajectory.

## **IV. Example ATIF Trajectory Log (Multi-Step Task)**

The following example illustrates a three-step task flow, where the user asks a question (step 1), the agent executes a search involving multiple tool calls (step 2), and then delivers a final conversational response (step 3).

**Task:** The user asks the agent to find the current price of a specific stock.

## **V. Real-World Trajectory Examples**

To illustrate the differences between existing agent trajectory formats and to provide concrete reference implementations, three example trajectories from different agent frameworks are available in the [`0001-trajectory-format/`](./0001-trajectory-format/) directory. All three trajectories execute the same simple task: _"Create a file called hello.txt with 'Hello, world!' as the content."_

### **Available Examples**

1. **[`mini-swe-agent-trajectory.json`](./0001-trajectory-format/mini-swe-agent-trajectory.json)** — MiniSweAgent format

   - Demonstrates explicit `THOUGHT` sections and bash command execution
   - Shows the conversational pattern where environment feedback is delivered as user messages
   - Includes detailed token usage and caching information from Claude 3.5 Sonnet
   - 3-step trajectory: create file → verify content → complete task

2. **[`openhands_trajectory.json`](./0001-trajectory-format/openhands_trajectory.json)** — OpenHands format

   - Structured as an event log with distinct action types (`system`, `message`, `run`, `finish`)
   - Includes extensive tool definitions and security risk assessments
   - Shows GPT-5 reasoning tokens (960 reasoning tokens in the response)
   - Demonstrates the `task_tracker` concept and rich observability metadata

3. **[`gemini-cli-trajectory.json`](./0001-trajectory-format/gemini-cli-trajectory.json)** — Gemini CLI format
   - Minimalist session-based format with message array
   - Includes embedded token metrics (input, output, cached, thoughts)
   - Single-step completion with Gemini 2.0 Flash
   - No explicit tool calls or structured actions

### **Key Insights from Examples**

These real-world trajectories highlight the diversity of current approaches:

- **Reasoning representation**: MiniSweAgent uses explicit `THOUGHT` fields, OpenHands embeds reasoning in tool calls, Gemini CLI tracks it in token metrics
- **Action logging**: Varies from bash strings (MiniSweAgent) to structured function calls (OpenHands) to implicit actions (Gemini CLI)
- **Observability**: OpenHands provides the richest metadata with tool call IDs and security assessments, while Gemini CLI is most minimal
- **Step granularity**: MiniSweAgent creates multiple steps for verification, while Gemini CLI completes the task in one step

ATIF aims to provide a unified format that can accommodate all these patterns while maintaining interoperability.

## **VI. Implementation**

### **Reference Implementation**

The Harbor project provides a reference implementation of ATIF in Python using Pydantic models for validation and type safety.

#### **Pydantic Models**

The complete ATIF schema is implemented as Pydantic models in the `src/harbor/models/trajectories/` directory:

- **`agent.py`** — Agent configuration model
- **`final_metrics.py`** — Aggregate trajectory metrics model
- **`metrics.py`** — Per-step LLM metrics model
- **`observation.py`** — Observation container model
- **`observation_result.py`** — Individual observation result model
- **`step.py`** — Step model with validators for timestamps and agent-only fields
- **`subagent_trajectory_ref.py`** — Subagent trajectory reference model
- **`tool_call.py`** — Tool call model
- **`trajectory.py`** — Root trajectory model with validators for step IDs and tool call references

These models provide:

- **Type safety** — All fields are strongly typed using Python type hints
- **Validation** — Automatic validation of required fields, types, and constraints
- **Custom validators** — ISO 8601 timestamp validation, sequential step ID validation, and tool call reference validation
- **JSON serialization** — `.to_json_dict()` method for clean JSON export with optional None exclusion

#### **Trajectory Validator**

The `src/harbor/utils/trajectory_validator.py` module provides a command-line tool and programmatic API for validating ATIF trajectory files:

```bash
# Validate a trajectory file
python -m harbor.utils.trajectory_validator trajectory.json
```

The validator:

- Accepts trajectory data as a dict, JSON string, or file path
- Validates against the complete ATIF schema using Pydantic models
- Collects all validation errors before returning (not just the first error)
- Provides user-friendly error messages with field paths

**Programmatic usage:**

```python
from harbor.utils.trajectory_validator import TrajectoryValidator

validator = TrajectoryValidator()
is_valid = validator.validate("trajectory.json")

if not is_valid:
    for error in validator.get_errors():
        print(f"Error: {error}")
```

#### **Integration in Agents**

The Terminus 2 agent (`src/harbor/agents/terminus_2/terminus_2.py`) demonstrates full integration of ATIF:

- Constructs trajectory steps using Pydantic models throughout the execution
- Tracks token metrics, costs, and logprobs in the `Metrics` model
- Records subagent trajectories with `SubagentTrajectoryRef` for context summarization
- Exports complete trajectories to JSON using the `Trajectory.to_json_dict()` method
- Automatically validates trajectory structure through Pydantic's runtime validation
