# Cloud + Desktop + Mobile Coding Sessions — Full-Flow Audit

**Date:** 2026-06-14
**Author:** Autopilot Coder audit lane
**Scope:** How OpenAgents Cloud (`cloud/`), the Pylon node + new Electrobun
Autopilot Desktop app (`openagents/apps/autopilot-desktop`), and the mobile
control surfaces fit together to deliver one goal:

> **Run coding sessions not only on my desktop but also on OpenAgents Cloud
> infra (SHC or Google), and administer them from a phone so I can code on the
> go.**

This audit reconciles four sub-system audits already in this folder
(`2026-06-13-cloud-remote-execution-commercial-plan.md`,
`2026-06-13-autopilot-desktop-app-audit.md`,
`2026-06-13-autopilot-desktop-reality-vs-claim-status.md`,
`2026-06-13-autopilot-remote-control-mobile-app-audit.md`,
`2026-06-13-autopilot-clients-roadmap.md`) plus the private `cloud/` repo
(`oa-node`, `oa-workroomd`, `oa-codex-control`, CND-0xx bootstrap docs) into a
single end-to-end picture, then names exactly what is missing to make the
"code on the go" loop real.

## 0a. Revision 2026-06-14 — owner direction

This revision fixes four priorities into the plan; everything below is read
through them:

1. **Ignore the iOS `control/` app.** The Swift Tailnet/WGPU console is not the
   mobile path. The **Expo remote-control app** is the single mobile surface
   for administering coding sessions. (`control/` may stay as an owner-only
   legacy console or be retired; it is out of scope here.)
2. **Cloud lane priority: Google Cloud first, SHC second.** For *running*
   coding sessions, GCE is the primary/default cloud lane; `oa-shc-katy-01` is
   the secondary lane. (This reverses the SHC-default recommendation in the
   first draft of this audit.)
3. **The Expo app already has OTA updates on our Google infra.** Self-hosted
   OpenAgents Updates (cloud `CND-OTA-1…8`, cloud issues #78–#85) run on Google
   Cloud; the Expo app ships via local builds (no Expo/EAS cloud) with JS OTA
   from that Google-hosted update service.
4. **Vortex credential is fine to reuse, but the Vortex codebase is
   deprecated.** Reusing the Vortex *grant-resolution credential/endpoint* for
   Codex/ChatGPT auth is acceptable; **do not add new code dependencies on the
   Vortex codebase.** New cloud-session wiring must reach grant resolution
   through a stable, Vortex-independent endpoint contract so the deprecated
   Vortex code can be removed without breaking the loop.

Issues filed for this plan are listed in **§9**.

## 0. TL;DR

**The two halves of this loop both exist, but they are not connected to each
other.**

- **Local execution is real.** Pylon runs bounded Codex/Claude coding sessions
  on your machine over a loopback control API (`127.0.0.1:4716`,
  `openagents.pylon.control.v0.3`). The new Electrobun **Autopilot Desktop**
  app is a thin, typed GUI client of that same control API and can spawn,
  list, cancel, and approve sessions today.

- **Cloud execution is real, but on a separate spine.** The private `cloud/`
  repo can run real Codex coding sessions on **SHC** (`oa-shc-katy-01` at
  `23.182.128.195`) and on **Google (GCE)** via `oa-node` + `oa-workroomd` +
  `oa-codex-control`, driven by an HTTP control API
  (`POST /v1/codex-runs`, contract `openagents.codex_workroom_assignment.v1`).
  This is wired to **Vortex**, not to Pylon or the desktop app.

- **Mobile is the weakest leg.** The shipped iOS `control/` app is a
  read-only Tailnet device-roster viewer (`GET /v1/snapshot`). It cannot see
  sessions, approve decisions, or spawn work. The real remote-control vision
  (React Native/Expo + bridge pairing + cursor-resumable streams) is
  audited and designed but **not scaffolded**.

**The missing middle is one unified control surface.** Today there are three
control planes that don't share a transport:

1. Pylon loopback control (`/command`, desktop + TUI clients) — local only.
2. `cloud/` `oa-codex-control` HTTP API (`/v1/codex-runs`) — Vortex client only.
3. iOS `control/` Tailnet snapshot (`/v1/snapshot`) — read-only roster only.

To "code on the go," these must collapse into **one control protocol** that a
phone, the desktop, and the web can all speak, with sessions placed on **local
Pylon, SHC, or Google** behind a single placement decision.

---

## 1. The Three Surfaces — What Actually Exists

### 1.1 Local desktop (Pylon + Electrobun Autopilot Desktop)

**Pylon** (`openagents/apps/pylon`) — published as `@openagentsinc/pylon`
(`0.2.5` stable, `0.3.0-rc2` rc). Two run modes:
- Interactive TUI dashboard (`pylon`).
- Headless node (`pylon node`) — HTTP control server on `127.0.0.1:4716`.

Pylon is the **execution authority** for local sessions: Codex adapter and
Claude Agent adapter (`@openagentsinc/claude-agent-bridge`), bounded workspace
fork, approval/decision queue, wallet state, coordinator loop, NIP-90 provider.

Control contract `openagents.pylon.control.v0.3`:
```
GET  /health                       -> { ok, schema }
GET  /events                       -> SSE node snapshot + heartbeat
POST /command                      -> session.spawn | session.list |
                                      session.events | session.cancel |
                                      approvals.resolve | coordinator.pause/resume |
                                      deploy.cloud | deploy.status | wallet.status |
                                      intent.submit | intent.list
GET  /sessions/:ref/events         -> SSE cursor-resumable per-session timeline
```

**Autopilot Desktop** (`openagents/apps/autopilot-desktop`) — new Electrobun
app (Bun main process + system-WebView Foldkit UI, ~10.5 kLOC, electrobun
`1.18.1`). Status after the 2026-06-13 fixes (CL-44…CL-59):
- Auto-discovers the local node home (`.pylon-local` / `.pylon-tailnet`,
  walking up from cwd) and reads `control-token`. The earlier "offline · 0
  sessions" bug (token-path mismatch) is **fixed** (CL-45 / #4958).
- Real sidebar + pane router; Foldkit-only webview rendering shared
  `@openagentsinc/autopilot-ui` components (CL-53 / #4966).
- Polls every 2s, renders sessions/decisions/accounts/wallet/deploy.
- Dispatches `spawnSession`, `cancelSession`, `resolveApproval`,
  `setCoordinatorPaused`, `submitIntent`, `deployCloud` as typed RPC →
  Pylon `/command`. Bearer token stays in the Bun process; webview only sees
  public-safe projections.

**Key architectural fact:** the desktop app is a *pass-through client*. It does
**not** execute, does **not** supervise the node process (P2), and does **not**
yet reach any remote or cloud node. `deployCloud` exists as a verb but routes
to Pylon's deploy gate, not to the `cloud/` coordinator.

### 1.2 OpenAgents Cloud (`cloud/`) — SHC and Google

Private Rust repo. Three binaries:

- **`oa-node`** — managed node daemon (register, capability detect, lifecycle,
  update/rollback, quarantine, settlement modes, Forge/Psionic/Probe
  attachment, broker redaction). Runs as `systemd`/`launchd` service.
- **`oa-workroomd`** — per-workroom sidecar. Owns the **Codex workroom
  runner**: assignment intake → session-scoped `CODEX_HOME` auth
  materialization → `codex exec` / `opencode run` → event normalization →
  content-addressed artifact closeout → resource-usage receipt → scrub.
- **`oa-codex-control`** — narrow HTTP control API that fronts the runner for
  async control from Vortex. Bound `0.0.0.0:8787`, bearer auth.

Control surface (`oa-codex-control`):
```
POST /v1/codex-runs                 -> queue async Codex run (202)
POST /v1/codex-runs/{id}/turns      -> continuation turn
POST /v1/codex-runs/{id}/cancel     -> cancel
GET  /v1/codex-runs/{id}            -> status
GET  /v1/codex-runs/{id}/events     -> events after cursor
GET  /v1/codex-runs/{id}/stream     -> SSE snapshot + heartbeat
POST /v1/training-runs              -> training/benchmark run
POST /v1/artanis/bootstrap         -> Artanis bootstrap run
```

Contracts: `openagents.codex_workroom_assignment.v1`,
`openagents.codex_workroom_event.v1`, `openagents.codex_auth_grant.v1`,
`openagents.resource_usage_receipt.v1`,
`openagents.compute_quota_routing.v1`.

**SHC** = Sovereign Hybrid Compute (OpenAgents' own/sovereign compute nodes hybridized with the Cloudflare control plane — *not* "self-hosted cloud"). The live MVP node is **`oa-shc-katy-01`**
(`23.182.128.195`, 16 vCPU / 62 GiB / KVM present, Ubuntu 24.04, Codex CLI
`0.135.0`, Firecracker `1.15.1` bootable). Codex runs under
`danger_full_access` inside the no-wallet VM boundary because the bubblewrap
`workspace-write` sandbox fails at the loopback layer on this host
(CND-041 / CND-055).

**Google** = GCE capacity class — **the primary/default lane for running
sessions per owner direction (2026-06-14).** `oa-gcp-shc-katy-01` is deployed
and smoke-tested (CND-033…CND-035). The commercial plan's C-5 shipped ephemeral
per-session GCE VMs (SSH metadata, firewall, labels, lifecycle, cleanup). SHC
(`oa-shc-katy-01`) is the **secondary** lane. Routing between Google and SHC is
governed by `openagents.compute_quota_routing.v1` (classes
`micro|standard|compute|gpu-standard|gpu-high`; caps 4 sessions/owner,
20/org; cost-plus-10% billing) — schema complete, **receipt comparison
(CND-042) not yet done**, so until then placement is policy-driven (Google
default) rather than cost-driven.

**Commercial plan status** (`cloud-remote-execution-commercial-plan.md`):
foundation wave **C-0…C-8 + C-11 merged** (#4886–#4894, #4897). Remaining
**C-9, C-10, C-12–C-15** ready to parallelize: static-SSH remote-verify
prototype, Model-2 inference gateway, tenant isolation + spend caps,
settlement bridge, **C-14 = wire the `openagents-cloud` provider backend in
the Pylon client to the `cloud/` coordinator**, and C-15 isolation benchmarks.

### 1.3 Mobile / remote administration

**The mobile path is the Expo app. The iOS `control/` Swift app is out of
scope (see §0a).**

- **The mobile surface (designed, not yet scaffolded):** React Native/Expo app
  at `openagents/clients/khala-ios/AutopilotRemoteControl/` (directory empty). Spec
  in `2026-06-13-autopilot-remote-control-mobile-app-audit.md`: bridge pairing
  (QR/bootstrap → scoped `PairingCredentialClaims`), cursor-resumable streams,
  decision relay, `expo-notifications` (APNs), projection levels. Build/ship
  policy: **off Expo/EAS cloud** — local `expo prebuild` →
  `xcodebuild`/`fastlane` → `xcrun altool`/ASC.
- **OTA already runs on Google infra.** Self-hosted OpenAgents Updates
  (`CND-OTA-1…8`, cloud issues #78–#85) serve the Expo app's JS OTA from Google
  Cloud — manifest endpoint, content-addressed asset store, `oa-update publish`
  CLI, channels/rollback, code signing, bsdiff/CDN, and the
  `openagents.mobile_update.v1` contract. So the *delivery* leg for the phone is
  already on the same Google infra we will run sessions on; what is missing is
  the *control* leg (session admin), not the update leg.
- **Web team dashboard:** `/autopilot`, `/autopilot/work`, `/decisions`,
  `/clients-preview` in `apps/openagents.com/apps/web` — currently
  fixtures-only, no live Pylon path, no team RBAC yet.

Shared spine for all clients: `@openagentsinc/autopilot-control-protocol`
(Effect Schema) defining `SessionSummary`, `SessionEvent`, `DecisionRecord`,
`bridge.*` verbs, `ProjectionLevel`, cursor dedup/resume logic.

## 2. How They Relate Today (and Where the Seams Break)

```
                         ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
                         │            SESSION CONTROL PLANES            │
                         │            (three, not unified)              │
                         └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  Desktop (Electrobun) ──RPC──> Pylon /command ──> LOCAL session (Codex/Claude)

                                @ 23.182.128.195:8787  [REAL, works today]

                                                         [NOT BUILT]
```

**The three breaks:**

1. **Desktop ↔ Cloud break.** The desktop app speaks `pylon.control.v0.3`
   only, to a *local* node. It has no client for `oa-codex-control`
   (`/v1/codex-runs`) and no `openagents-cloud` provider path. So a coding
   session you start in the desktop app can **only** run on your local machine.

2. **Pylon ↔ Cloud break.** The Pylon `openagents-cloud` execution-provider
   abstraction (commercial plan C-1/C-14) is specified but **not wired to the
   `cloud/` coordinator**. The cloud runner today is reachable only from
   Vortex's HTTP callbacks (`OA_VORTEX_CODEX_VM_CONTROL_URL`). Pylon cannot
   place a job on SHC or GCE.

3. **Mobile ↔ everything break.** The shipped mobile app sees a device roster,
   not sessions. The bridge transport (system #39 — pairing, capability
   scoping, cursor-resumable streams, decision relay) is **partially built in
   Pylon and not consumed by any phone client**. There is no APNs path.

**The one piece that already spans both spines** is the normalized payload
`openagents.autopilot_coding_assignment.v1` (Stack-B work-order spine), which
was *designed* to be lane-agnostic across Pylon, SHC, cloud, and hosted lanes.
But the work-order spine itself "has never executed real coding" — only a
validation-class smoke (#4633) — and is not what the desktop app drives.

---

## 3. The Target End-to-End Flow ("Code on the Go")

The flow you want, decomposed into the legs each surface must own:

```
 PHONE                    CONTROL PLANE                 EXECUTION LANE
 (Expo)                   (unified bridge)              (placement-selected)

 1. Open app  ───pair──>  bridge.pair.exchange  ──>  scoped credential
                          (QR from desktop/web)       (capabilities + expiry)

 2. New session ──spawn─> session.spawn {              placement selector picks:
    {objective,            objective, verify,           - LOCAL Pylon (free, own machine)
     verify, lane?}        lane: auto|local|            - SHC oa-shc-katy-01
                           cloud-shc|cloud-gcp}         - GCE ephemeral VM
                                                        |
 3. Watch     ──stream──> session.subscribe ─────────> normalized event stream
    progress              (cursor-resumable)            (codex_workroom_event.v1
                                                         ↔ pylon SessionEvent)

 4. Approve   ──relay───> decision.resolve ──────────> exactly-once to runner
    a decision            (single-use, replayable)      (approval queue)

 5. Get push  <──APNs───  decision_required /          notification fan-out
                          session_finished              (refs-only payload)

 6. Accept /  ──review──> work review or artifact.read  artifact closeout
    download              (public-safe projection)      (sha256/<digest>)
```

For this to work, **three contracts must converge**:

- **Transport:** one bridge that a phone can reach over Tailnet/relay, that
  brokers to either Pylon (local) or `oa-codex-control` (cloud). Either Pylon
  becomes the single front door (it proxies to cloud) or a new thin coordinator
  fronts both.
- **Event model:** `openagents.codex_workroom_event.v1` (cloud) and the Pylon
  `SessionEvent` shape must map to one normalized stream the mobile app renders
  identically regardless of lane.
- **Placement:** a `lane` selector on spawn (`auto|local|cloud-shc|cloud-gcp`)
  honoring the existing placement policy (own-Pylon-first-and-free; repo trust
  tiers: regulated→SHC-only, private→own/verified, public→any) and the cloud
  quota-routing contract.

---

## 4. Gap Analysis — What's Missing Per Leg

### Leg A — Desktop can start a cloud session
**Have:** Desktop RPC `spawnSession{adapter,objective,verify}` → Pylon
`/command`. Pylon `openagents-cloud` provider spec (C-1).
**Missing:**
- A `lane` parameter on `session.spawn` (`auto|local|cloud-shc|cloud-gcp`).
- Pylon `openagents-cloud` provider backend wired to `oa-codex-control`
  (**C-14**) — translate a Pylon spawn into `POST /v1/codex-runs` with a
  resolved `codex_auth_grant.v1`, then mirror `codex_workroom_event.v1` back
  into the Pylon session event stream.
- Desktop UI affordance to choose the lane and show "running on
  oa-shc-katy-01 / GCE" provenance.

### Leg B — Pylon ↔ Cloud coordinator transport
**Have:** `oa-codex-control` async API + job registry + Vortex callbacks. SHC
node live; GCE deploy tested.
**Missing:**
- A **coordinator/placement** layer Pylon can call that is not Vortex-specific.
  Today routing is hard-wired via `OA_VORTEX_CODEX_VM_CONTROL_URL` +
  `OA_VORTEX_CODEX_VM_RUNNER_ID`. Need a placement endpoint that accepts a
  lane-agnostic assignment and returns a runner binding (SHC vs GCE) per
  `compute_quota_routing.v1`.
- **Auth-grant brokering for Pylon-originated sessions, Vortex-codebase-free.**
  The cloud runner resolves Codex/ChatGPT grants from Vortex today
  (`OA_VORTEX_GRANT_RESOLVE_URL`). Per §0a the Vortex *credential/endpoint* is
  fine to reuse, but the Vortex *codebase is deprecated* — a Pylon/
  desktop-originated cloud session must reach grant resolution through a stable,
  Vortex-independent endpoint contract (rename the env to a neutral
  `OA_CODEX_GRANT_RESOLVE_URL`, keep the Vortex URL behind it for now) so the
  deprecated Vortex code can be deleted without breaking the loop. BYO key per
  commercial-plan Model 1, or OpenAgents credits via the Model-2 egress gateway
  (**C-10**), apply unchanged.
- **CND-042 receipt comparison** so Google↔SHC placement can become
  cost-driven; until then Google is the policy default.

### Leg C — Mobile can administer sessions
**Have:** shared `autopilot-control-protocol` package; Pylon bridge verbs
partially built; design spec complete.
**Missing (all of it, in build terms):**
- Scaffold the Expo app at `clients/khala-ios/AutopilotRemoteControl/`
  (clients-roadmap M1; fast-track #4919 for TestFlight via local build).
- Finish Pylon **bridge transport (system #39)**: `bridge.pair.exchange`,
  `bridge.revoke`, `bridge.clients.list`, capability-scoped credentials,
  cursor-resumable `session.subscribe`/`history`, `decision.resolve` relay,
  `artifact.read`.
- **Remote-reachable bind** for the control server (Tailnet/LAN, not just
  loopback) — clients-roadmap M2; today desktop discovers `.pylon-tailnet` but
  the bridge auth is single all-or-nothing bearer.
- **APNs push** (`expo-notifications`) for `decision_required` /
  `session_finished|failed` with refs-only payloads.
- Mobile lane selection + provenance (same `lane` param as Leg A).

### Leg D — Administration parity & safety
**Missing:**
- Decision-queue spine that is exactly-once across desktop, web, and mobile
  (unified roadmap M5–M8 / #4763–#4766) so an approval from the phone is
  idempotent with the desktop.
- Per-session spend caps + kill switch for cloud lanes (commercial-plan C-12),
  tenant identity (WorkOS) for any non-owner use.
- Settlement: cloud `resource_usage_receipt.v1` → customer credit/invoice
  ledger in the public monorepo (C-13) — only needed once cloud minutes are
  billed; for owner dogfthat can stay `internal-accounting`.

---

## 5. Recommended Build Path (Owner-Dogfood First)

Sequenced so you reach "code on the go on cloud infra" with the **fewest new
parts**, dogfooding before any multi-tenant/billing work. This deliberately
makes Pylon the **single front door** (the desktop and phone keep speaking
`pylon.control.v0.3`; Pylon brokers to cloud) rather than teaching every client
to speak `oa-codex-control` directly.

**Phase 1 — Pylon becomes a cloud client (unblocks desktop cloud sessions).**
1. Validate/repair the Pylon `openagents-cloud` provider backend
   (commercial-plan **C-14**, closed but not demonstrably end-to-end): on
   `session.spawn{lane:"cloud-gcp"|"cloud-shc"}`, Pylon resolves a
   `codex_auth_grant.v1` (via the Vortex-independent endpoint, §0a), calls the
   cloud control API, and maps `codex_workroom_event.v1` → Pylon `SessionEvent`
   so the existing `/sessions/:ref/events` stream is lane-transparent.
2. Add a thin placement endpoint in `cloud/` (or extend `oa-codex-control`)
   that accepts a lane-agnostic assignment and binds the runner per
   `compute_quota_routing.v1`. **Default Google GCE (primary); SHC secondary.**
   Until CND-042 lands, placement is policy-driven (Google default), not
   cost-driven.
3. Add the `lane` parameter end-to-end (control protocol → desktop RPC → UI),
   `auto` = own-Pylon-first-and-free, then **Google GCE** for cloud, SHC as
   fallback.

   *Exit proof:* spawn a real repo-edit session from Autopilot Desktop that
   runs on a **Google GCE** ephemeral VM, streams events back into the desktop
   timeline, and produces a content-addressed artifact +
   `resource_usage_receipt.v1`.

**Phase 2 — Remote-reachable bridge (unblocks the phone).**
4. Finish Pylon bridge transport / system #39: pairing, capability scoping,
   cursor-resumable subscribe, decision relay, revoke/clients.list, over
   Tailnet/LAN bind (clients-roadmap M2).
5. Scaffold the Expo app and ship a **read-only** build to TestFlight via the
   local build path (no Expo/EAS cloud), with JS OTA from the Google-hosted
   OpenAgents Updates service (`CND-OTA-*`): pair → list sessions → stream one
   session's events (works identically for local and cloud sessions because
   Phase 1 made the stream lane-transparent).

   *Exit proof:* on the phone, watch the Phase-1 **Google GCE** session stream
   live.

**Phase 3 — Mobile write actions + push.**
6. Add `decision.resolve`, `session.spawn{lane}`, `session.cancel`,
   `turn.steer` to the mobile app behind capability gates.
7. Wire `expo-notifications`/APNs for `decision_required` and terminal events.
8. Make the decision queue exactly-once across desktop/web/mobile (M5–M8).

   *Exit proof (the actual goal):* from the phone, away from the desk, spawn a
   coding session that runs on **Google GCE** (SHC fallback), get a push when it
   needs a decision, approve it, and accept the artifact — desktop shows the
   same session state throughout.

**Phase 4 — Hardening for non-owner / billed use (only when opening up).**
9. Model-2 inference gateway (C-10), tenant identity + spend caps + kill switch
   (C-12), settlement bridge cloud→public ledger (C-13), CND-042 cost-driven
   SHC↔GCE routing, microVM isolation benchmarks (C-15).

---

## 6. Decisions

**Settled (owner direction, 2026-06-14 — see §0a):**

- **Cloud lane:** Google GCE first, SHC second.
- **Mobile:** Expo app is the mobile surface; iOS `control/` app is ignored.
- **OTA:** Expo updates already run on Google infra (`CND-OTA-*`); reuse, don't
  rebuild.
- **Auth:** reuse the Vortex grant *credential/endpoint*, but add no new
  dependency on the deprecated Vortex *codebase* — route grant resolution
  through a Vortex-independent endpoint contract.

**Still open:**

1. **Front door:** make **Pylon the single control front door** (recommended —
   one protocol for all clients, Pylon brokers to cloud) vs. teaching the
   desktop/phone to speak `oa-codex-control` directly (two protocols on every
   client). This audit assumes Pylon-as-front-door.
2. **Model-2 timing:** owner dogfood can run cloud sessions on the existing
   subscription-backed grant path (`internal-accounting`, no-wallet). Confirm
   we defer the Model-2 credits gateway (C-10) until we open up to non-owners.

## 8. Issues filed (2026-06-14)

**Epic:** openagents **#4996** — *Code on the go: desktop + Expo coding sessions
on OpenAgents Cloud (Google-first).*

**Phase 1 — Pylon becomes a cloud client (desktop → Google GCE):**
- openagents **#4997** — Pylon `openagents-cloud` provider: live desktop→Google
  GCE session proof (revalidate C-14).
- openagents **#4998** — lane selector (`auto|local|cloud-gcp|cloud-shc`)
  end-to-end (Google default).
- openagents **#4999** — Vortex-independent Codex grant-resolution endpoint
  contract.
- cloud **#86** — placement endpoint: lane-agnostic → runner binding (GCE
  primary / SHC secondary).
- cloud **#87** — `oa-codex-control`: Pylon-originated assignments + callbacks
  (non-Vortex).
- cloud **#88** — GCE ephemeral-VM Codex session lane as default (warm path).

### #4997 implemented — Pylon `openagents-cloud` execution backend (2026-06-14)

The Pylon `openagents-cloud` provider now dispatches cloud-lane control
sessions to the cloud control plane instead of running them locally. It builds
on #4998 (lane plumbing) and #4999 (Vortex-independent grant resolver).

- **Modules:** `apps/pylon/src/cloud-control-client.ts` (HTTP transport + event
  normalization) and `apps/pylon/src/openagents-cloud-provider.ts`
  (`makeCloudControlSessionExecutor`, the `ControlSessionExecutor` for cloud
  lanes). Wired into `createControlSessionActions` via a lane-aware executor
  selector and into production through `makeSessionActions` in
  `apps/pylon/src/index.ts`.
- **Env gate (new, neutral):** `OA_CLOUD_CONTROL_URL` + `OA_CLOUD_CONTROL_TOKEN`
  enable the cloud control plane. Grant resolution reuses
  `OA_CODEX_GRANT_RESOLVE_URL` / `OA_CODEX_GRANT_RESOLVE_TOKEN` (#4999). When
  the cloud vars are unset, cloud lanes degrade to the local executor, so a
  Pylon with no cloud config still works locally exactly as before.
- **Loop:** resolve grant (when grant refs present) → `POST /v1/placement`
  (`openagents.codex_placement_assignment.v1`, lane GCE primary / SHC secondary)
  → poll `GET /v1/codex-runs/{externalRunId}/events?cursor=N` →
  `POST /v1/codex-runs/{externalRunId}/cancel` on abort.
- **Event mapping** (cloud `openagents.codex_workroom_event.v1` kind → Pylon
  `ControlSessionEvent`): `queued`/`placement.bound`/`started`/`log`/`redacted`
  → `composer_event` (bounded, redaction-scanned message text);
  `artifact` → `composer_event` + collected `artifactRef`s; `receipt` →
  `composer_event` + the `openagents.resource_usage_receipt.v1` ref surfaced on
  the session; `completed` → terminal `completed`; `failed`/`timeout` →
  terminal `failed`; `cancelled` → terminal `cancelled`. The existing
  `/sessions/:ref/events` stream is therefore lane-transparent.
- **Provenance:** the resolved runner binding (lane + `providerLane` + runner
  id + `externalRunId`) is recorded on the session record/projection
  (`cloudRunner`) so the desktop "running on Google GCE / SHC" indicator is
  real. Refs-and-limits only; no raw owner identity, cost, project id, IP, or
  credentials.
- **Tests:** `apps/pylon/tests/openagents-cloud-execution-backend.test.ts`
  drives a faked cloud control plane proving spawn `cloud-gcp` → grant resolved
  → placement/events called → events mapped into the Pylon stream → terminal +
  artifact + receipt surfaced, plus the failed-terminal path and the
  no-cloud-config local fallback.
- **Scope deferred (cloud repo):** live GCE/SHC VM provisioning, warm pools,
  and CND-042 cost-driven placement. Pylon targets the documented HTTP contract
  only.

**Phase 2 — Remote-reachable bridge + Expo read-only app:**
- openagents **#5000** — Pylon bridge transport (system #39).
- openagents **#5001** — scaffold Expo remote-control app (read-only),
  TestFlight via local build, OTA from Google.

**Phase 3 — Expo write actions + push:**
- openagents **#5002** — Expo write actions (decision.resolve/spawn/cancel/steer).
- openagents **#5003** — Expo push (expo-notifications/APNs).
- openagents **#5004** — exactly-once decision queue across desktop/web/Expo.

**Placement maturity (deferred):**
- cloud **#89** — CND-042: GCE↔SHC receipt comparison → cost-driven placement.

**Foundation, already closed (do not re-file):** Cloud remote-exec C-0…C-15
(openagents #4886–#4901). C-14/#4900, C-10, C-12, C-13 are closed-as-completed
but the loop is not yet demonstrable end-to-end; #4997 + the cloud children
revalidate/repair rather than rebuild. C-10/C-12/C-13/C-15 are reopened only
when we open to non-owners (Phase 4).

## 9. Bottom Line

You already own both engines: a working **local** coding-session runtime
(Pylon + Electrobun desktop) and a working **cloud** coding-session runtime
(`cloud/` on SHC and Google). What is missing is the **drivetrain** that
connects them and the **steering wheel in your pocket**:

1. **C-14** — wire Pylon's `openagents-cloud` provider to `oa-codex-control`
   so a desktop/phone spawn can land on SHC or GCE (lane-transparent events).
2. **System #39 bridge** — make Pylon remotely reachable with scoped pairing
   and cursor-resumable streams.
3. **Expo remote-control app** — scaffold it, ship read-only to TestFlight,
   then add approve/spawn/cancel + APNs push.

Do those three, in that order, and "spawn a coding session from my phone, run
it on OpenAgents Cloud, approve its decisions on the go, accept the result"
becomes a real, demonstrable loop — with the desktop and cloud you've already
built doing the actual work.
