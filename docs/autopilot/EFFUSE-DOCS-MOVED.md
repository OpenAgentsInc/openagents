# Effuse and apps/web integration docs — moved

All Effuse and apps/web (router, Effect, RPC, hydration) documentation has been consolidated under:

**`packages/effuse/docs/`**

- **Start here:** [ROUTER-AND-APPS-WEB-INTEGRATION.md](../../packages/effuse/docs/ROUTER-AND-APPS-WEB-INTEGRATION.md) — router, Effect, RPC, auth cache, navigation
- **Index:** [INDEX.md](../../packages/effuse/docs/INDEX.md) — full list of Effuse and integration docs
- Effuse conversion, effect-migration-web, effect-rpc-web, tanstack-start-effect-comparison, DELEGATION-full-effect-integration, and related ADR copies live there.

This file exists so links from other autopilot docs can point to the new location.
