# B-001: Simple File Edit

## Description
Tests the agent's ability to perform a simple file modification task.

## Category
file-ops

## Difficulty
Beginner

## Setup
Creates a single file `version.txt` containing:
```
version = 1.0.0
```

## Task Prompt
```
Change the version number in version.txt from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1
```

## Validation Criteria
- File `version.txt` must exist
- Content must contain "1.0.1"

## Success Metrics
- Execution time < 5 seconds (typical)
- Minimal token usage
- Single tool call expected (Edit or Write)

## Common Failures
- File not found (deleted instead of edited)
- Incorrect version number (typos)
- Extra modifications beyond version change

## Custom Metrics
None

## Notes
This is the simplest benchmark and serves as a baseline for agent functionality.
