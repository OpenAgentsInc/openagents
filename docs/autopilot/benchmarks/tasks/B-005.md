# B-005: Branch Workflow

## Description
Tests the agent's ability to perform a complete git branch workflow including creating a branch, making changes, committing, and merging.

## Category
git

## Difficulty
Intermediate

## Setup
- Initializes a git repository
- Configures git user (Benchmark / bench@example.com)
- Creates README.md with initial content
- Makes initial commit

## Task Prompt
```
Create a new branch called 'feature', add a new file called 'feature.txt' with content 'New feature', commit it, then merge the branch back to main
```

## Validation Criteria
1. Branch 'feature' was created (or existed during workflow)
2. File `feature.txt` exists in working directory
3. `feature.txt` contains "New feature"
4. File is present in git history (committed)
5. Merge occurred (feature branch merged to main)

## Success Metrics
- Execution time < 30 seconds (typical)
- Multiple git operations performed correctly
- Clean git history with merge commit

## Common Failures
- Branch not created
- Changes not committed before merge
- Merge conflicts (shouldn't happen in this simple case)
- Feature branch not merged back
- File created but not added to git

## Custom Metrics
- `commits_made`: Number of commits in git log (should be >= 2)

## Git State Requirements
Final state should have:
- A merge commit in the history
- feature.txt tracked in the repository
- Clean working directory

## Notes
This benchmark tests understanding of git branching workflows, a fundamental skill for development agents.
