## Transcript

[00:00] Good.

[00:05] Hello.

[00:07] Welcome to the Austin Bitcoin Club.

[00:10] Also known as ABC.

[00:13] I'm Paul.

[00:14] I will be your moderator tonight for a very exciting panel called built different.

[00:21] The rise of AI powered Bitcoin bills.

[00:27] So we're going to try to figure out what Bitcoin and AI have to do with each other.

[00:33] If anything.

[00:35] Welcome to Bitcoin Park.

[00:37] First of all, this session is being recorded and live streamed.

[00:42] But we'll cut the live stream for the Q&A so you can ask all your deepest darkest questions.

[00:48] So this panel is built different.

[00:52] And AI is shifting how and what people build for Bitcoin.

[00:56] You don't need a big team to build software anymore.

[00:59] You might not even need to be a developer.

[01:01] So we want to explore what AI makes possible for us as Bitcoin builders.

[01:06] And maybe just importantly, what is Bitcoin and the Bitcoin ethos offer that the AI world is currently lacking.

[01:14] And AI is a huge topic with a lot of rabbit holes on its own.

[01:19] So I'm excited to have three amazing Bitcoin builders with us to unpack this.

[01:24] So first off, we have Justin Moon.

[01:28] I would say that Austin Bit Dev's Godfather would you appreciate your passion for this community Justin.

[01:37] He's now leading the AI for individuals program at HRF.

[01:43] Part of the AI for individuals.

[01:47] It's an individualistic pursuit.

[01:49] So how did you go from Bitcoin influencer to AI influencer?

[01:55] It's an interesting question.

[01:56] Yeah, I don't know if I was ever a Bitcoin influencer.

[01:58] But definitely passionate about Bitcoin and like to organize events and build a community.

[02:04] Here I was just looking at my phone.

[02:06] We were asking how many years have we been doing meetups here.

[02:09] And in a little last in a month, it'll be seven years of we've been doing these meetups.

[02:14] The first ones were much smaller than this.

[02:16] And a core workspace.

[02:18] One couple were in a library until unchanged stepped up and started hosting them.

[02:22] And they've been a gracious host for like at least six years now.

[02:25] So yeah, so I spent a lot of time working on Bitcoin and then took a break.

[02:30] And I actually got interested because I played with some of the AI coding tools.

[02:36] I never really found them very useful.

[02:38] But then I went to a program called Sovereign Engineering in Medira.

[02:42] Actually, I was actually sleeping on it.

[02:45] His couch at his hotel room, he invited me.

[02:47] He said, I got a couch.

[02:48] And so that's the only reason I went.

[02:50] And it was funny the first week we were all writing code by hand like cavemen.

[02:55] And he always the only one who was experimenting with the cursor code editor.

[03:00] So it's a code editor.

[03:01] It looks very similar to a traditional code editor.

[03:03] But it has a little pain on the side where you can give it instructions in English.

[03:06] And it'll spit out a little code for you.

[03:08] And we were all just really wowed by what Paul is doing.

[03:11] And so this is amazing.

[03:12] And so every week, it was a six week program every week.

[03:15] I was only playing to stay two weeks.

[03:16] I ended up staying six.

[03:17] I joked a GG, the guy who runs it at the end and I'm surprised I'm still here.

[03:22] I was planning on leaving a month ago.

[03:24] And there's no idea why I stayed because the AI coding tools became kind of addictive.

[03:28] There were some projects that I had a thought of, like previously I was working at

[03:32] FETI and stuff that were like, man, somebody I'd like to build that.

[03:35] But it's not really hard.

[03:36] I don't know how to do it.

[03:37] And so some of these coding tools I would, I found, you know,

[03:40] like a, like a really research and kind of plan out how this could be possible.

[03:44] And like I demonstrated that it could be possible.

[03:46] And I ended up building some of those like very complex that I'd always wanted to do,

[03:49] but didn't know how and thought it was kind of intimidating.

[03:51] And then a couple weeks we were able to, I was able to make a prototype of it.

[03:54] So that's what really opened my eyes is like, okay,

[03:57] you can do these more complex, difficult things.

[03:59] I also didn't have to try as hard, which was really nice, right?

[04:02] Because like sometimes to do a really hard coding thing,

[04:05] it's really almost sold raining.

[04:07] You have to really get like totally in the zone and really locked in.

[04:11] And that's not always possible.

[04:13] And it's not always enjoyable with some of these AI tools.

[04:17] You, you can sort of take a little bit of a step back and almost conjure your program as if you were a wizard, you know?

[04:23] So I like that feeling, you know, if you're like a wizard.

[04:27] And so that's how I got into it.

[04:29] Awesome. Thank you.

[04:30] Saw Hill, Trudeau V80.

[04:33] Designer at Foundry, using AI to build products in the world of mining and infrastructure.

[04:40] So I'll highlight, I host the Bitcoin Design Club together, so it's good to see you again.

[04:45] It's been a while.

[04:46] How are you using AI to build on Bitcoin?

[04:50] I think so yeah, I work at Foundry.

[04:52] It's like mining pulled because mining pulled out there.

[04:55] I haven't been in the big amount, like it was traditional tool that we use for months.

[05:00] So that's probably where you lived for like four or five years before.

[05:04] Yeah, it's just like my whole like career basically, you just in these like design tools where you're drawing rectangles basically.

[05:11] And then I started using V0, which is like one of these basic vibe coding tools essentially.

[05:17] And there's problems. There's nothing's perfect in where working it through, working through it and working different workflows and figuring things out.

[05:24] But it's been so much faster.

[05:27] And I think what Justin was talking about, the friction of getting started with something is a lot less.

[05:32] And then even the friction of iterating frankly, like even during the last meetup, I was kind of like I had V0 open and I was just like talking to it and be like, oh, update the straw down and you'll just kind of.

[05:42] That's what you're doing.

[05:43] That's what you're doing.

[05:44] That's what you're doing.

[05:45] You want to participate in our meetup.

[05:46] That's thanks for.

[05:47] Well, it's kind of a fun about it.

[05:48] About it being a dick thing.

[05:50] It was just like I couldn't like go V0.

[05:53] Yeah, that's what I'm.

[05:54] And it almost feels like a game kind of right like it has the same sort of you get kind of addicted to it.

[05:59] Like you do in a video game, which is a fun fun loop.

[06:03] Christopher David founder of open agents working on Bitcoin aware autonomous agents.

[06:09] Could you explain to us, Chris, what what are open agents and what do they matter in a Bitcoin contact.

[06:16] Yeah, so we'll start with just agents, which you may have heard of or are getting sick of as everyone's talking about agents.

[06:23] Agents agents agents and every company that we've ever heard of is adding something to do with agents.

[06:27] My simple definition of an agent is just like a piece of software that uses AI to take action in the world on your behalf.

[06:36] How most people are going to interface with AI is starting to shift to this is going to be less.

[06:44] Company with a model that you're just chatting to.

[06:48] It's going to be increasingly a thing that you can delegate a task to and it goes and does it for you and you can have multiple of these.

[06:52] You can have multiple of these agents working kind of asynchronously. So I was able to both participate in the meetup and have my agent going because the agents off to in here and let's me, you know, should poster talk and be loud in the meetup.

[07:03] So doing things asynchronously and the beautiful thing about agents is that you can have five 10 15 20 of them theoretically running on you are behalf.

[07:11] So that's agents and then open agents like agents I think need to be open.

[07:17] I did some little analysis ahead chat GPT crunched some numbers about like give me some realistic.

[07:24] Some what conservative estimates of how many AI agents are going to be loose in the world.

[07:30] This year next few years and the decade and it said that probably about a billion this year.

[07:36] 10 billion by 20 29 okay so we're about to be outnumbered on this planet by AI agents should these things be open source should we know what they're doing and what they're saying.

[07:46] Or should we trust that you're a local.

[07:49] For profit closed source AI lab some of which are taking funding from who knows what or authoritarian regimes should be owning all of this.

[07:58] Partnering with governments building fucking.

[08:00] Distopent control grid no so we think that.

[08:04] To the extent the extent to which these agents generally are open or closed is going to determine whether AI becomes a centralizing influence.

[08:13] And you get these big labs getting their tendrils around governments or a decentralizing influence that empowers people so we think agents need to be open open agents is also the name of the company to help do that.

[08:26] Thank you guys and yeah I'm Paul Miller I guess I didn't introduce myself I'm a front and developer using AI to build things all the time now used to work on mutiny I'm working on another wallet project right now and.

[08:40] Yeah so I guess what I wanted to lead off with and you guys already really answered a lot of how this is already really integrated in our lives and what we're working on but are we at the right me to right now.

[08:52] So they do do AI and Bitcoin have some strong correlation or these just you know parallel tracks or just these are just you know dev tools basically these like two tastes that.

[09:04] And so we're going to be really great together like what what is the correlation is is this is this whole meet up a force.

[09:11] So I have a simple answer like so I got interested in Bitcoin because I thought it could like really try you know make a big change in like society.

[09:20] And a positive change right so I thought it could really like fix a lot of problems like a lot of problems that we fight about politics for example probably not can actually be able to fix via politics right like you know.

[09:32] The US government runs surplus is like I don't know if politics is actually under the current circumstances is going to be going to get you there but maybe Bitcoin could right like by putting things on a stronger.

[09:43] More honest monetary foundation like that could fix a lot of things downstream and so you know that just big impact I think AI is every you know passing week or month it seems like AI will also have a really big impact.

[09:56] But it's a lot less clear whether it will be positive or negative right like there's a lot of very positive things about it but there are also some very negative things about it right sometimes you know there's this kind of.

[10:06] You know.

[10:07] So oftentimes you hear about some of the biggest proponents or the biggest players in the AI talking about their vision of the future society and in the way they talk about it's like well we're going to make this infinitely powerful machine and it's going to eliminate scarcity and you're going to give us all the power and we're going to take care of you right so it's it's is a lot like communism basically like they're they're they're pitch is a lot like the like the Soviet pitch was like a hundred years ago right and.

[10:35] And so that's always very alarming right it's not a vision of the future that I think is is very compelling and so that's kind of part of there's a lot of started getting interested this one you know the one way they're similar is I think Bitcoin and AI are both going to really change how the world works.

[10:53] And like hopefully by having some Bitcoin people start to participate in the AI world we can you know bring them in a little more freedom oriented direction.

[11:03] Yeah, I don't have anything super profound to say like Justin maybe just coming from like a day to day approach.

[11:11] I do care about privacy that's true, but I feel like the benefit that I'm getting from.

[11:17] Right now or are so vast that I'm kind of just like speed running this and just like telling you everything about my life so I do wish our local friends.

[11:29] Anthony and Marks are running open secret maple is like a private AI kind of thing.

[11:35] I maybe the relation to Bitcoin is like if if you had the.

[11:40] If you were to be able to buy Bitcoin but in a less private way versus not buying it I probably say buy it anyway and then learn better privacy.

[11:49] So I'm kind of in a place where I'm just like I'm just going to use the tools anyway even though it's kind of scary from a panoptic on point of view potentially until things like maple and open secret and maybe open agents and that kind of stuff.

[12:03] It gets us to a better place. I don't know if that went anywhere but that's what.

[12:08] Justin maybe think of.

[12:12] My favorite quote from Michael Sayler a talkie gave a few months ago he said.

[12:20] Starting off with a compliment before he go into the other side of it.

[12:24] Use cloud code I think he said use cloud code.

[12:29] He said the AI economy is going to be a 100 trillion dollar market and it's going to be built on Bitcoin.

[12:36] I agree.

[12:38] Bitcoin's at a $2 trillion market cap so some amount of that probably will be reflected in the price of the base asset but.

[12:46] More importantly for those of us who care about the medium of exchange use case of Bitcoin and not just the store value use case of Bitcoin.

[12:56] I think that if we can provide an answer to the question of.

[13:01] Conference of global

[13:21] Um, a whole bunch of people seem to think that that makes sense.

[13:24] I think that it makes sense.

[13:26] Uh, however, a whole bunch of the sort of energy and excitement from companies like

[13:32] stripe, which is buying up stablecoin companies left and right.

[13:36] A lot of the large entities funding the stablecoin legislation going through DC.

[13:42] These are not Bitcoiners.

[13:44] These are part of my friends, shit coiners or otherwise people that are betting on the

[13:50] fiat system and trying to get their crypto-ish tendrils around fiat.

[13:54] Um, I don't know that they're building the kind of world that I want to live in.

[13:59] The world that I want to live in is truly centralized, voluntary and hey, I'm a big fan of

[14:04] if Bitcoin kind of um, is adopted by all governments and all corporations and those kinds of things.

[14:09] But, um, I hope to have that peer to peer cash use case, uh, solidly implemented without having

[14:17] governments, uh, you know, try to make legislation that that prohibits or makes puts obstacles in front of

[14:24] Bitcoin as money.

[14:25] I think AI and AI agents in particular are how we can collectively definitively solve that.

[14:32] If we have 10 billion AI agents next year, transacting in Bitcoin, paying in Bitcoin, paying out

[14:39] their creators in Bitcoin and just generally building up the AI agent economy to use Bitcoin,

[14:45] I think it's going to be that that will win Bitcoin as MOU definitively maybe in the next 18 months.

[14:52] So one other way I think about this is like, uh, just more from an individual level, right?

[14:57] Uh, not like a society level at an individual level, right? Like you in an economic sense, it's like you

[15:01] you labor and then you do stuff with the fruits you're labor, right? Maybe you transact, maybe you save, right?

[15:06] Bitcoin helps with the latter part, right? You can save and you can transact more freely and more

[15:12] effectively, but it doesn't help you even more productive, honestly, uh, necessarily like really.

[15:17] And that's one thing AI I think can really really help with is it can make you a more productive person.

[15:22] And so, uh, there's sort of two sides of the economic coin, right? The, uh, the, like, you know,

[15:29] yeah, the more productive you are, the more Bitcoin helps, right? Because you can, uh, you can, you,

[15:35] you know, now you can Bitcoin with more or a sad threat, right?

[15:38] Yeah, I mean, along those lines that's kind of where I was going with my next questions, it's a

[15:43] beautiful set up, uh, Justin. I mean, so, some background for me, I became a Bitcoin builder

[15:49] partly because I took a class from Justin. I had to, I had to learn Python just to get into his class as

[15:56] terrible. And, uh, and now I'm inspiring the next generation. I'm now your vibe coding. So it's, you know,

[16:03] it's a, it's a beautiful virtuous circle, but I'm curious, does AI change, we've all been building

[16:09] Bitcoin products for the past few years. Does AI change who can become a builder? Does it change the

[16:17] path to becoming a builder, Bitcoin products? And it like, what is the skill set for someone who

[16:23] wanting to like, I have ideas, things I want to build in the Bitcoin economy or Bitcoin specific

[16:29] products? Like, what, what is the new skill set for the inspiring builder?

[16:34] Yeah, I mean, so we've been sort of witnessed an example of this last cult like,

[16:38] month or two, with Marty Bant, who's at a studio here for a long time. And so he, you know,

[16:44] like, two months ago, he came running out of here, like, look at this, uh, just anything I just

[16:49] vibe-go to, right? Uh, right? And so it's like, the idea was to have help people to nominate the

[16:54] world in Bitcoin, right? So it made like this, uh, I'd call it an app generously, I'll call it an app

[17:01] to a Chrome extension. Yeah, yeah, so it like a very basic version of it that could just like change

[17:07] the price on Zolo for a couple things, right? But we had a proof of concept and we could actually

[17:11] play with it, which is much more compelling, like usually when someone has an idea for an app,

[17:15] and they try to explain it to you as a developer, especially it's like, oh God, this guy has no

[17:19] idea we're talking about, right? But then, you know, if you have, if you're empowered by like,

[17:24] a tool to actually make a working prototype that works, the vision is much more compelling, right?

[17:30] So that was Marty, like six weeks ago, or a month ago, and then he was able to find a kid

[17:35] off-nostor who was like a professional developer, but a very junior one, right? Like, maybe he couldn't

[17:39] pull this off in the past, and they were able to partner up and build this Chrome extension now that

[17:44] they have launched. And so it's really cool, you install it, and then anytime it sees like a dollar price,

[17:50] I'm like, let's say, like he's a venture capitalist, so like he was posting a screenshot of

[17:55] it's like some company that raised around a funding. And what he saw was not the dollar value,

[17:59] it's how many Bitcoin, right? It's like, oh wow, that's an 800-800 Bitcoin round. That's a really

[18:03] big venture capital round, right? And so now it's really interesting because, you know, he's,

[18:09] I'm sure he's had ideas like this for seven, eight, ten years. He's been doing that

[18:13] that newsletter for like ten years almost, but only now it is he started building software, right?

[18:17] So, you know, this is like literally the podcasters are now writing apps, right? Which is

[18:22] the podcast that they're taking a job. Yeah, exactly. It's a horrifying prospect, but it's also an inspiring

[18:29] one, right? Because if you have a good idea, you can, it's much more easy, it's much easier to

[18:35] bring it into the world. And so from that, it's like, it's like an evidence that the people who are

[18:40] developing software are changing. Yes, kind of a similar story for me. I mean, I study computer science

[18:46] and college, but I never really actually built anything at all. And so there was always the friction,

[18:53] and that's why it became an honestly, it was like playing with rectangles. Yeah, just playing with

[18:57] colors and fonts exactly. It's actually, but there was always this friction of like the

[19:04] corrupt around the code. And I was like, I don't know what's happening. This is too annoying.

[19:09] And then when I started finding these tools, I was like, I think the one thing I did out of work,

[19:14] the first time that really blew my mind was our friend Ben Carmen has this tool,

[19:19] opera turnbot, which just lets you write something, I mean, controversially maybe, but write

[19:24] something to the chain basically. Or feed you the chain. Or feed you the chain. Or feed you the chain.

[19:30] I love Ben. I hated the UI. It was like total just not great. But it works really well. And so I

[19:36] just tried. I was like, what if I came up with a project plan with GPT and then plugged it into V0 and

[19:41] like, could I vibe a better UI? And I just after a few back and forth and like, I think Ben had to

[19:47] do something with the ZAPI or whatever. I don't even know what it would it. Like literally V0 was like,

[19:51] oh, this isn't working. And I just said, what question should I ask the developer to unlock it?

[19:56] And I'll ask Ben and then Ben has it been with fix it and it will come back and he works. Like it

[20:00] actually made a better UI that I could write stuff to the chain. Thanks to Ben's tool.

[20:05] Yes, I mean, this is one of the hardest things in software development is actually the communication.

[20:09] Right? Like many projects, especially like contract projects fail because the community, the developer

[20:14] does not understand what the product owner is saying and vice versa. Right? This is like a classic thing.

[20:18] You see over and over and over again, right? And so in a sense, these tools are like a translator

[20:23] between these different roles in the creation of software. And it's just software now, but in the

[20:27] future, I can see this happening with like movie production. All these other things where it's like

[20:32] this thing can sort of is almost like a linger fronca in some sense.

[20:37] One maybe uncharitable saying I've heard is AI makes the incompetent competent and it makes the

[20:43] competent prolific. So if you've never coded a website before, it can like get you over that

[20:48] hump of like now you've made a website for me I've been coding for 30 years and it just,

[20:53] it lets me be way way way more ambitious about the things where I'm like, I'm now like writing a web

[20:58] framework and an agent marketplace. Like all this stuff, I just never would have done like single

[21:02] handedly in the past. One I think dynamic where Bitcoin helps here and just the kind of like built-in

[21:09] interoperability that people are building on open protocols make available. So I saw some some tweet

[21:15] at I think maybe like the the level of all guys, uh, level Twitter account, uh, posted up some

[21:21] some stat that they had like 250,000 apps made over the weekend and someone responded, where are they?

[21:30] Who who who's using these is like, well, okay, those that type of building apps, it's like it's not

[21:36] so much for your distributing this to other people. And I just say early, but people are building

[21:41] personal software for them. Either they think it's cool or it's like providing some value to them.

[21:45] And that's great to start. Imagine if those 250,000 builders had access to some kind of marketplace

[21:53] where they could easily make some money for an app and now you've got some sort of like market force,

[21:58] some kind of discovery where it's like, oh wait a second, I built an app that does this, but I don't

[22:03] have payments, I don't know how to what to do. Wait a second, you over here, you both have plug-in

[22:07] that I can easily drop into my app that lets me take like any payments or whatever that is.

[22:12] And enable people to start to collaborate to kind of build software collaboratively. I don't

[22:18] think anyone's really leaned into that, I think we were well positioned to do that. What we're

[22:22] launching on Saturday takes a step in that direction. So stay tuned. I feel like I've seen a lot of

[22:26] examples, maybe not as much recently, maybe my algorithm changed, but like somebody would launch

[22:32] an experimental project, like look at this cool thing I made with AI and it's also burning my

[22:38] API key tokens. So I'm gonna shut it off when I become poor. But yeah, if it was easier to ship

[22:44] monetization that makes a lot of sense, along those lines, you know, you talked about, you have these,

[22:51] maybe I like a call like micro apps, like it's really fun to make like a home cook app for your

[22:56] buddy, you know, or the proof of concept, like what right now is the not the right thing to be

[23:03] building with a or is it just a skill issue? Not the right thing. I mean, like, you know,

[23:15] somebody was explaining their way of working with these tools. And basically they were saying like

[23:25] if you're, if you see the code you're in jail, right, and you got to stop looking at the code, right? So

[23:31] it's kind of a funny phrase, right? Like, you know, usually a developer is always looking at the code,

[23:34] but you have to sort of train yourself not to look at it when you're a vibe coding. He's like,

[23:38] you know, you don't want to be looking at the code. That's jail. Like you got to free yourself from the code

[23:42] for yourself, for yourself from the details and like a send, right? And, and I'm like, well, what about Bitcoin

[23:47] corn? He's like, same thing, get out of jail. Let's vibe code, Bitcoin core. And I'm like, oh my god,

[23:53] I don't know how I feel about that, right? But maybe I'm still in jail. I don't know. So my

[23:57] answer would be like maybe not like fully Bitcoin core, but you can also, you can, you know,

[24:03] I would hope that the Bitcoin core developers are still looking at the code, you know?

[24:07] But it can still, I think it can still be assisted, because it's like, you know, all these tools will

[24:13] they'll lie, cheat and steal, right? They'll, they'll, they'll, they'll put out stuff that doesn't

[24:18] actually work. They'll hard code, example. I was working on a lightning thing and it was working,

[24:22] it was sending and receiving, and then I looked at the code and it was replacing the payment

[24:27] hashes with just these random ideas. It was generating itself. Yeah. Like it did like a really

[24:33] good job of putting like a nice prefix on each one. It was great hashes, but not the payment.

[24:39] You told it to display a bolt 11 invoice and every time it displays a bolt 11 invoice, you know?

[24:46] So yeah, I mean, I think it, you still, well, a lot of this, you know, you still want human and loop.

[24:49] You still like this example with Marty, I was telling you, buddy, he's like, I'm just going to vibe

[24:53] because I'm like, you know, that's a great idea, but maybe you should get someone else involved who

[24:57] can still like validate what you've done and that worked really well for him, right? So I think there's,

[25:02] you still want, you know, you still want some human expertise and there you want to understand

[25:07] what's actually happening. So it's not necessarily like what you'd work on with it, but it's

[25:14] kind of how, right? So you still want, you don't want to just completely turn your brain off and

[25:19] just pray to the model weight gods and I have a tweet to illustrate this. I'm going to read this

[25:23] tweet thread. So just some developer guy. So when not to use like, when what not to use it for, like,

[25:30] when people are expecting you to maintain a certain bar of quality, but going to be when he's

[25:34] able with anyway, so it's a conversation during code review, aka he works in a company in the review

[25:38] and code, hey, me, hey, I can't understand the logic here. Are you sure that invariant is maintained?

[25:43] Them. Don't know, Claude wrote it. Me having dark thoughts and then all in caps. You are

[25:49] responsible for the code you murdered. It doesn't matter who wrote it. I guarantee you that test

[25:53] generated by Claude for this delicate, distributed transaction logic are bullshit and test shit

[25:57] all. I refuse to dig through this slide at 9 p.m. when it inevitably breaks, lowercase, back to

[26:01] being happy fellow. I'll have a long and lucrative career fixing the slap other devs push now.

[26:07] I do think there's like an etiquette to like, at least telling somebody, oh, by the way, this is

[26:11] slap. I mean, if you've ever gotten an email that was very clearly written by Chad Gbt, right?

[26:16] It's like four times too long. It has like four M dashes, right? What's the couple of the words it

[26:22] loves to use? Right? It's like a little bit of slim pulling. You're so right. Yeah, you're so right. Yeah,

[26:27] like it's overly polite, right? So like that's what a lot of the code is starting to look like and

[26:31] certain parts of the get up right now, right? So there's obviously some downsides too, but that doesn't

[26:35] mean the tools bad. It means just like, well, learn to use it a little better, right? There's

[26:39] something similar from a design point of view. I'm just thinking back like even today when I was like

[26:43] at work, I've been really pushing myself to not use Figma and just even if it doesn't work,

[26:48] just be at the edge as much as possible, but there's still a lot of times where like, like fonts,

[26:53] the font will be off or like things will be off. And then I just have to fall back to the idea that,

[26:58] okay, my developer has the actual component and he can kind of guess that like, okay, this trip

[27:03] is going to be like our actual component library trip and not, you know, VZero's trip. So

[27:08] I don't think that's like the eventual future, like eventually I'm hoping that these tools will

[27:12] integrate with your component library, we were talking about this, but from now I'm kind of just like,

[27:17] if the question was what not to do, I'm kind of pushing the line, I think from a design point of

[27:21] like, okay, it's not going to be perfect, but the vibe is right, the vibe is right and it feels so good.

[27:29] So yes, so let's get a little practical for people, what AI tools are you like actually working

[27:37] well for you, you know, day to day, what's your, what's your creative stack and any like prompting tips or like pitfalls

[27:45] your, your seeing. I'm going every time, how about you start? Yeah, I can start. I pretty much typically have

[27:54] GPT or I usually use a growl on, I just like GPT on the side and then on one side I'll have VZero or

[28:01] something where I can like something like VZero or ball to which is kind of visual again, I'm a designer,

[28:05] so I have that and then GP, so GPT is kind of like my PM assistant, so I'll, I'll literally talk to

[28:12] it, I think I've mentioned this before in other AI meetups here, but I'll use this tool called Superwisper

[28:19] and a base it's hold down function and just like talk with my voice to the models and I don't have

[28:24] to type the hate typing, I just get basically transcribes that you say into the text box. It's amazing

[28:29] and and LLM's are great, I just taking your rambling into like cohesive, yeah, like a perfect sentence

[28:35] that doesn't have a lot of like substance to it, doesn't get you very far, but like a run on sentence with

[28:41] no punctuation, it has a lot of substance to it, they're really good at it. And sometimes I'll even

[28:47] contradict myself, I'll go down one path and I'll be like actually that was stupid, ignore all that,

[28:51] do this next part. So I'm literally taking, taking a diving to the extreme and it's really fun.

[28:58] For the last two years, I've been constantly bouncing between stuff that like open AI or anthropic will make

[29:05] and then kind of getting pissed off at that and like making my own version. And so I just constantly

[29:10] bouncing between them, they'll put out like a better version, like a crap, so I can switch back

[29:14] up a bit, continually switching back and forth. These days, I'm still in an anthropic mode because

[29:18] Claude Code is just the best coding agent that's out there hands down. But part of the reason that

[29:24] it's so good is because they're they're lighting piles of money on fire. There's a tool where

[29:30] so you have a flat fee, I pay for the $200 a month plan and you can run a tool not from

[29:35] anthropic, but it tells you how much you would have spent on that inference compute if you were paying

[29:41] in the paper use. And my number for the last month is $6,000. So I'm just throwing it and

[29:46] seeing them, I'm caught, don't tell them that, but I'm causing them a lot of money, causing them a lot of

[29:51] money. It's like, how do you freaking compete with that now? Probably unsustainable things and they'll

[29:58] change that or the pricing model will change. And I get why they do it if you have infinite cash

[30:04] from VCs. Then of course you want to try to subsidize usage and try to like buy me as a user.

[30:09] Doesn't really work because I'm not loyal to them at all and I want to get away from them as

[30:12] soon as possible for various reasons. But one is like it just points to me to the task that

[30:20] I want to help solve, which is where is the actual value? Because I'm happy to pay for token usage

[30:28] if it's something that's going to create more than the value that I get back for the token.

[30:33] And is is clawed the only company that I want to discover that with? No, I want to access to deep

[30:39] seek. I want to access to open AI stuff, I want to access to open models and I want it all in one place.

[30:44] So this is another thing that we're trying to build around, having to be model like now

[30:48] I think I can pull in all of the best models. You don't need to care about what lab is doing what.

[30:52] You just go to the one interface, obages.com and everything's kind of orchestrated the back end

[30:56] of work in progress. Yeah, so one of the things I like to Christopher kind of talked about the

[31:01] coding agent part and so I want to talk about that. But one thing I like to do is use these tools as

[31:08] like a kind of a research partner or like a conversation partner where you know my assumption is that

[31:15] they either have sort of ideas that I don't have or can give me feedback on my ideas. Tell me what's

[31:19] possible because what like an LM does is it like kind of compresses the whole internet, right?

[31:23] They try to feed it all the stuff, everything on the internet, it kind of reads the internet

[31:27] and then it has like vague memories of what it sees and it has a better memory of what it sees more

[31:31] less of a memory of what it sees less often. So it's like okay, it'll have these ideas that

[31:35] because it's seen the whole internet and so that's one of the things I really love to do is we're like

[31:39] I have this idea, I like it's very fuzzy like is this possible right like is there something like

[31:45] this, have you seen something like this before? Could you go on search for stuff like this like go

[31:51] scourget.com for me? I have this idea, tell me how it isn't possible. Like is there is there

[31:57] anything fundamentally like broken about this right and I'll go ask it with three of them right? I'll

[32:03] say you're a grock same question Google you know open AI, cloud I'll ask them all right the best model

[32:10] crank it up and then they'll disagree with each other and I'll just get them fighting right like okay

[32:15] another guy yeah I'll literally like that this one right? I'll just like would you say yeah exactly.

[32:20] So you know and so like this sort of thing is very good it's like this is my plan right? What am I missing?

[32:27] That's one of the best things these things can do is like what are the unknown unknowns you know

[32:32] that's almost one of the most magical things about these because like sometimes like you're

[32:36] working on something and you're going to have an unknown unknown for like a couple of years. There's

[32:39] like just known about that thing right where so these these these tools can sort of have have

[32:45] some of those ability into everything on the internet and so sometimes they can present you an

[32:49] idea and so that that is really useful to me and it's something that I think it's it's applicable

[32:55] by everybody. Yeah I love this I just have one more thing to add because I think it's kind of related

[33:02] this was a couple months ago probably everyone's seen this but Toby the sea of Shopify put out this

[33:07] like letter ones to all of his employees it was like everyone needs use AI it's like mandatory now

[33:12] but I think the thing that resonated for me the most was this phrase he used it was something like

[33:18] all all teammates must have like a reflexive use of AI and I so I don't know if everyone here agrees with

[33:23] that but for me that was a big unlock or it resonated a lot with this idea of just any time I think

[33:29] of anything but period the first thought should be reach for GPT to like unblock me one useful

[33:36] heuristic you can apply is to be is like almost treat yourself like a researcher where you're trying

[33:41] to figure out exactly the line of what they can and can't do right so don't just give it give it

[33:46] stuff that you know I can do right like try to punt it things that you like think it

[33:50] fine things it can't do right and sort of develop in your own mental model of the world where

[33:55] is the boundary between what any I can do and can't do and then as you use it I like this is one

[34:00] joke in AI startups is like you know if you have if you build some product feature that doesn't work

[34:06] now save the code make a note to soften your calendar for a month or two later and try it again

[34:13] so like there was I just read a blog post that we talked about in the meetup where this is

[34:16] coding agent called amp and they're like hey we wanted to do this sub agent thing right where

[34:20] for a specific task the agent delegates to more specialized agent to do it and I like we tried this

[34:25] with cloud 3.7 didn't really work it just couldn't it wasn't a good orchestrator and then

[34:31] cloud four comes out they run the same code and it works beautifully right so it's like that's I think

[34:36] that's one of the really good like in the basic premise here is that these tools are getting smarter

[34:42] and they are getting smarter every month so far it hasn't really stalled and so that's a really

[34:46] useful thing and why I think the reason one reason why this has been official is you often find things

[34:51] are possible today that you didn't you wouldn't have guessed what right if you were just you know

[34:56] hitting the same button over and over again doing the the one thing you know that will work

[35:00] I am yeah I love that idea of having the theory of mind and you mentioned yeah these updates

[35:07] coming along and you know we all mentioned a bunch of different tools like I mean I could imagine

[35:14] somebody being especially if they're on the outside looking in kind of intimidated by the choices

[35:20] and they may be they're keep on hearing like all if you don't get get it on board you're going to

[35:23] get left behind or like imagine a lot of fear of like keeping up but also fear of missing out

[35:29] and like could you help people with that some of that decision per hour is it?

[35:33] Yeah I mean something I and I failed to say a couple weeks ago I was I went really overboard trying

[35:37] all these brand new agents and I just said like my mind was shattered and I just didn't

[35:41] write any code for two weeks I was like after this right like this is horrible I'm done right I'm

[35:46] not actually I just took a break but so I failed at this three weeks ago but one thing that

[35:52] helps is to just do it poorly right like it's just like okay I'm gonna try this new thing this

[35:56] something really bad with it don't even try to like really succeed just do something and

[36:00] and just just try something just try and oftentimes if you make something

[36:08] improve that and then pretty soon you're off the races right you don't have to you know like

[36:11] stick the landing necessarily I think that's fun that's what I would do is like if you're having fun

[36:16] just keep trying stuff like we all have fun playing with the stuff sometimes yeah but then I think

[36:21] of like like I was talking my dad and I was trying to convince him to download GPT or

[36:25] growk or like try to make it reflexive but then I started thinking about I was like eventually

[36:30] Google would just have it in it like Gem and I would just be completely integrated and take it over so

[36:35] if you just wait a few more months it's gonna he doesn't have to like change his behavior so maybe

[36:40] that's one answer is like yeah I like the feeling that it's moving so fast that I don't have to

[36:44] keep up because what if I go on vacation for two weeks I'm gonna miss like seven announcements I just dip

[36:49] back into this okay so let's update cursor button yeah just let me cursor and all my problems are

[36:56] solved sub agents finally I have sub agents let's talk about AI and and freedom I mean it's maybe

[37:04] a show of hands who here has been censored by an AI when you asked the perfectly innocuous question

[37:10] about how to make something in your kitchen with common ingredients okay so a lot of people have

[37:15] been since I've been you know rejected a million times by AI and so there's obviously a lot of

[37:22] levers of control and a lot of the AI stuff is being kind of built by the old tech in some sense the

[37:30] same tech that you know the gave us Facebook so how do we keep our personal ethos and the Bitcoin ethos

[37:38] in this world and how do we make sure that these tools and the creators of these tools don't

[37:43] undermine those values they be Christopher can leave the self I feel like yeah I just think the the

[37:49] cipher punk ethos that motivated early Bitcoin and hopefully still Bitcoin belongs exactly in AI just

[37:56] the exact same mindset and maybe that's why I'm so feel so comfortable in AI because I just

[38:02] realized that like it doesn't matter if there's just massive massive companies where that's not

[38:06] reflected like we know that people like us banding together with some fucking math incentives can

[38:13] like take on these massive institutions so we we need the cipher punk ethos I think I think that

[38:19] largely can be reflected in this dichotomy between our systems open or our systems closed and I just invite

[38:25] you to experiment with whatever tools that you you know find easy and right now it might be easy to

[38:32] kind of experiment or learn with chat GPT or some of these other folks but I hope that you will support

[38:39] your local Bitcoin AI builders as we're putting out alternatives and be beta testers for us

[38:44] give us the feedback that we can better help you and get all of us off of these old you know

[38:49] we're well-earned controlled systems better closed yeah I mean this is it this is a tough this is this is

[38:57] really one of the most important questions I think and yeah I'm still very much resting with it

[39:04] I mean one thing I think yeah I agree with this point of just like I mean I'm oftentimes

[39:18] feeling at this one as well as don't don't you know don't try to just completely surround your

[39:22] life to chat GPT right like don't don't let yeah exactly like I mean but it's something like you can

[39:27] you can recover if this is already happened too right like you know it's a convenient thing so you'll

[39:32] fall back into it right like you'll you'll you know you'll go back to some people end up going back to the

[39:39] you know it's like you relapse to shit coins or something right like this is something that happens

[39:46] but you know like at least have like this is for me I'm like at least try because I don't

[39:51] use the local models as much as I'd like for example right the ones that you can run on your own computer

[39:55] right like I'm always planning to use them more because this is kind of a more self-solver and more

[40:00] open way of interacting with these technologies but they're dumber right so they don't fix my my

[40:06] they don't help they don't prove it's my productivity as much as possible but so I always have this

[40:11] intent to try as much as I can to return to those and maybe I mean I'd like to build more experiences

[40:17] on top of those that would be useful for specific tasks are they always gonna be dumber you think the

[40:22] open I mean I don't I don't I don't think necessarily like there are all the a lot of the open ones

[40:27] are like as smart as the proprietary ones were like a year or a year and a half ago right they're just

[40:31] they trail kind of in time and so if uh if the you know the the increase in capability of the

[40:41] closed frontier models uh it's an asymptote then you can imagine a world where the the older ones

[40:48] are able to catch up right uh the the open ones are able to catch up so I don't think it's necessarily

[40:53] uh uh always gonna be that way but it's also harder you know the even the the most the best open models

[41:00] uh are like I can't run on my laptop right you need a lot of specialized hardware you know

[41:06] tens of thousands of dollars of computers to run one of these things in the in the in the most

[41:10] uh the the most performant way right so even if it's a smart model you can't necessarily run it in

[41:16] like a self-solvering way so uh so that's that's one thing I mean I think just a lot more like

[41:22] experimentation and you know a lot of the people in the AI ecosystem uh you know like AI Twitter it's like

[41:30] what they want to do is make a good y-commonator application that's like their goal right to get into

[41:36] a start-up accelerator race the money get rich right like that's what most of them are kind of trying to

[41:41] and uh you know a lot of the people in the Bitcoin world like uh the Galpers are constantly kind of

[41:46] choosing to do that right like there's many of them that could go that route and they make more money

[41:50] they do more successful right but they they wouldn't uh live up to their values so like you know

[41:55] if more of these people like and you start on nostory right now like a lot of there's a lot of people

[41:59] building a bunch of interesting kind of AI use cases uh in the in the in the nostory world right now

[42:07] and many of these people could you know they're they're they're sort of making a different choice

[42:10] on how to spend their time they're not just running to the thing that will make the most money they're

[42:14] doing trying to do something that's open and useful to a small group of people and they can maybe uh

[42:18] kind of grow from there so so that's that's one thing is like just a lot more kind of

[42:23] tinkering and uh trying to find things that are useful and accessible and not necessarily the thing

[42:29] that's going to make the most money um is you know I hope that that's what that's what the Bitcoin

[42:34] is of doing with their software development for the last 12 13 years right like nobody who works on

[42:39] Bitcoin Core is doing it because that's how they're going to maximize their income right uh but they do it

[42:44] nonetheless so yeah a lot a lot more of that you know and just uh I think more or just you know

[42:49] kind of see something say something right just being more aware of like some of the privacy trade

[42:53] us for example right like if if if you know if you think the ad targeting is bad now right we're like

[43:00] you you look at some YouTube video and all of a sudden Instagram you know serving ads to you right like

[43:05] the next generation of the stuff could just be like orders of magnitude more powerful or like

[43:09] nose your mind better than you to right like this is pretty alarming um and so you know just talking

[43:15] about these things and uh trying out new new things like maple right like a friend of the meetup

[43:21] Anthony is building a sickle maple tray at open agents try it right i'm just going to say yeah maple

[43:26] my use case with maple is uh i like journaling with no limbs and and putting all that into uh

[43:32] tragedy fatigue would i think would be insane i think uh or could have unintended consequences

[43:38] down the line so i that's what i use maple for is like whenever i'm like okay if this was public

[43:43] would i be okay with that uh then i would use maple but i wish i wish you know it was like just

[43:49] i could use maple for everything the other note so i answered it for just kind of me personally but like

[43:54] with the aside from helping out the human rights foundation right uh uh an organization that

[44:00] traditionally does uh like a pro democracy advocacy right they support democracy activists throughout

[44:06] the world who are trying to you know make their regimes more democratic and so they got interested in

[44:10] Bitcoin because they they found it useful for deploying capital to their so the people they were supporting

[44:16] and they ended up doing a big grant program i think they've given out like $8 million with the grants

[44:20] for all kinds of interesting Bitcoin projects that wouldn't have been probably existed without that

[44:26] right because the developers weren't able to uh to uh to do it they support a bunch of uh i mean

[44:32] somewhere here there there's a sponsor this space for example right um there's a logo back there right

[44:37] they sponsor a BTC++ right so so that's kind of what we're trying to do with uh the AI

[44:43] trying to have a somewhat fact in the AI right so we're going to do a lot of grant programs

[44:47] both in education and in uh you know encouraging kind of small independent developers to build

[44:53] tools that are kind of uh privacy freedom oriented and we're also going to talk a lot about how

[44:59] authoritarian regimes are are uh abusing these tools you know to to take away freedom and that's

[45:07] a little less of my role at HRF but that's something we're going to do and uh and just make people

[45:11] more aware that these some of these AI tools are really you know you know if these things will really

[45:16] help the creation of a surveillance state where you don't have a freedom or agency.

[45:21] A lot of slump. I don't know if guys have been on YouTube recently it's just kidding it's just

[45:27] getting ridiculous all these fake videos it's meaningless mindless. I mean the four you to have

[45:32] on Twitter right now it's just horror all it's like mostly blah for me I mean all right we're going

[45:38] to open up to audience Q and A so I guess we're supposed to cut off the stream right um so yeah

[45:43] anything you guys are curious about anything you guys want to ask anybody on the panel think we might

[45:48] know about.
