# Unreleased

Entries accumulate here between releases. Appending an entry when your change
lands on `main` is part of the CLAIM-RELEASE protocol — see `README.md` in
this directory for the required format. `pnpm changelog roll` moves these
entries into the next dated release file.

## Sarah voice is attached to messages (#9013)

- issues: #9013
- commits: 2e4177fe64
- contracts-specs: Sarah Mobile Speech Delivery in INVARIANTS.md; Effect Native Card long-press projection
- invariants: no permanent speech bar; one active owner-private clip; only its exact message shows bounded state
- evidence: apps/openagents-mobile/tests/sarah-owner-orchestrator.test.ts; apps/openagents.com/packages/effect-native-render-rn/src/index.test.ts
- lane: codex.root.sarah-message-voice

Sarah's permanent “Listen · AI-generated voice” bar is gone. Long-press any
completed Sarah response to prepare and play its AI-generated voice; the exact
message shows a compact preparing, playing, or failed state, and long-pressing
the active message stops it. Sarah's composer also restores native autocorrect.

## Desktop restart failures no longer repeat (#9012)

- issues: #9012
- commits: aaccf71781
- contracts-specs: Desktop Development Restart Authority in INVARIANTS.md
- invariants: restart coordination is one-shot and failure notices are claimed once per request
- evidence: apps/openagents-desktop/tests/oa-dev-supervisor.test.ts; apps/openagents-desktop/tests/electron-boundary.test.ts
- lane: codex.root.restart-notification-loop

A failed Desktop development restart now produces at most one notification and
stays stopped until a new restart is explicitly requested. The running app is
preserved when a handoff fails, so a port conflict cannot become a repeating
macOS notification loop.

## Sarah shows verified tool activity in chat

- issues: none (direct owner request)
- commits: c2ff92159c
- contracts-specs: openagents_mobile.sarah.live_tool_activity.v1; INVARIANTS.md Sarah tool-visibility invariant
- invariants: Sarah tool use and success/failure may no longer be hidden by conversational presentation
- evidence: docs/mobile/2026-07-19-openagents-mobile-sarah-live-tool-activity-ota-receipt.md
- lane: codex-owner-session-sarah-tool-visibility

Sarah now shows a short live activity line when she uses a real tool, and the
line updates when its confirmed result arrives. Internal tool names, IDs,
arguments, raw results, provider plumbing, and token dumps stay out of the
conversation.
