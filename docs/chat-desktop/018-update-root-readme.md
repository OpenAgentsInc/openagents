# Issue #18: Update Root README with macOS Chat Interface and Links

## Phase
Phase 5: Testing & Documentation

## Priority
Low-Medium — Developer onboarding clarity

## Description
Update the top-level `README.md` to reflect the new macOS chat interface, Option A (local JSON‑RPC) on desktop, and add quick-start notes and shortcuts. Link to ADR‑0007 and the chat-desktop docs.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Add a brief “macOS Chat Interface” overview (sidebar + chat + inspector)
- [x] Mention Option A (local JSON‑RPC adapter) and Tinyvex persistence succinctly
- [x] Add key shortcuts reference for macOS
- [x] Link to ADR‑0007 and docs/chat-desktop
- [x] Ensure instructions still build and run cleanly

## Changes
- Updated `README.md` with a new “macOS Chat Interface” section, shortcuts, and links to ADR‑0007 and docs/chat-desktop.

## Status Update — Completed
Applied and pushed. Root README now reflects the chat-first macOS architecture and points to ADR‑0007 and docs/chat-desktop for deeper guidance.
