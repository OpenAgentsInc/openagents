# Agent Skills in the SDK

Extend Claude with specialized capabilities using Agent Skills in the Claude Agent SDK

---

## Overview

Agent Skills extend Claude with specialized capabilities that Claude autonomously invokes when relevant. Skills are packaged as `SKILL.md` files containing instructions, descriptions, and optional supporting resources.

For comprehensive information about Skills, including benefits, architecture, and authoring guidelines, see the [Agent Skills overview](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview).

## How Skills Work with the SDK

When using the Claude Agent SDK, Skills are:

1. **Defined as filesystem artifacts**: Created as `SKILL.md` files in specific directories (`.claude/skills/`)
2. **Loaded from filesystem**: Skills are loaded from configured filesystem locations. You must specify `settingSources` (TypeScript) or `setting_sources` (Python) to load Skills from the filesystem
3. **Automatically discovered**: Once filesystem settings are loaded, Skill metadata is discovered at startup from user and project directories; full content loaded when triggered
4. **Model-invoked**: Claude autonomously chooses when to use them based on context
5. **Enabled via allowed_tools**: Add `"Skill"` to your `allowed_tools` to enable Skills

Unlike subagents (which can be defined programmatically), Skills must be created as filesystem artifacts. The SDK does not provide a programmatic API for registering Skills.

<Note>
**Default behavior**: By default, the SDK does not load any filesystem settings. To use Skills, you must explicitly configure `settingSources: ['user', 'project']` (TypeScript) or `setting_sources=["user", "project"]` (Python) in your options.
</Note>

## Using Skills with the SDK

To use Skills with the SDK, you need to:

1. Include `"Skill"` in your `allowed_tools` configuration
2. Configure `settingSources`/`setting_sources` to load Skills from the filesystem

Once configured, Claude automatically discovers Skills from the specified directories and invokes them when relevant to the user's request.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import asyncio
from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions

async def main():
    options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
        cwd="/path/to/project",  # Project with .claude/skills/
        setting_sources=["user", "project"],  # Load Skills from filesystem
        allowed_tools=["Skill", "Read", "Write", "Bash"]  # Enable Skill tool
    )

    async for message in query(
        prompt="Help me process this PDF document",
        options=options
    ):
        print(message)

asyncio.run(main())
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { query } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";

for await (const message of query({
  prompt: "Help me process this PDF document",
  options: {
    cwd: "/path/to/project",  // Project with .claude/skills/
    settingSources: ["user", "project"],  // Load Skills from filesystem
    allowedTools: ["Skill", "Read", "Write", "Bash"]  // Enable Skill tool
  }
})) {
  console.log(message);
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Skill Locations

Skills are loaded from filesystem directories based on your `settingSources`/`setting_sources` configuration:

- **Project Skills** (`.claude/skills/`): Shared with your team via git - loaded when `setting_sources` includes `"project"`
- **User Skills** (`~/.claude/skills/`): Personal Skills across all projects - loaded when `setting_sources` includes `"user"`
- **Plugin Skills**: Bundled with installed Claude Code plugins

## Creating Skills

Skills are defined as directories containing a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter and Markdown content. The `description` field determines when Claude invokes your Skill.

**Example directory structure**:
```bash
.claude/skills/processing-pdfs/
└── SKILL.md
```

For complete guidance on creating Skills, including SKILL.md structure, multi-file Skills, and examples, see:
- [Agent Skills in Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills): Complete guide with examples
- [Agent Skills Best Practices](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices): Authoring guidelines and naming conventions

## Tool Restrictions

<Note>
The `allowed-tools` frontmatter field in SKILL.md is only supported when using Claude Code CLI directly. **It does not apply when using Skills through the SDK**.

When using the SDK, control tool access through the main `allowedTools` option in your query configuration.
</Note>

To restrict tools for Skills in SDK applications, use the `allowedTools` option:

<Note>
Import statements from the first example are assumed in the following code snippets.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    setting_sources=["user", "project"],  # Load Skills from filesystem
    allowed_tools=["Skill", "Read", "Grep", "Glob"]  # Restricted toolset
)

async for message in query(
    prompt="Analyze the codebase structure",
    options=options
):
    print(message)
```

```typescript TypeScript
// Skills can only use Read, Grep, and Glob tools
for await (const message of query({
  prompt: "Analyze the codebase structure",
  options: {
    settingSources: ["user", "project"],  // Load Skills from filesystem
    allowedTools: ["Skill", "Read", "Grep", "Glob"]  // Restricted toolset
  }
})) {
  console.log(message);
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Discovering Available Skills

To see which Skills are available in your SDK application, simply ask Claude:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    setting_sources=["user", "project"],  # Load Skills from filesystem
    allowed_tools=["Skill"]
)

async for message in query(
    prompt="What Skills are available?",
    options=options
):
    print(message)
```

```typescript TypeScript
for await (const message of query({
  prompt: "What Skills are available?",
  options: {
    settingSources: ["user", "project"],  // Load Skills from filesystem
    allowedTools: ["Skill"]
  }
})) {
  console.log(message);
}
```

</CodeGroup>

Claude will list the available Skills based on your current working directory and installed plugins.

## Testing Skills

Test Skills by asking questions that match their descriptions:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    cwd="/path/to/project",
    setting_sources=["user", "project"],  # Load Skills from filesystem
    allowed_tools=["Skill", "Read", "Bash"]
)

async for message in query(
    prompt="Extract text from invoice.pdf",
    options=options
):
    print(message)
```

```typescript TypeScript
for await (const message of query({
  prompt: "Extract text from invoice.pdf",
  options: {
    cwd: "/path/to/project",
    settingSources: ["user", "project"],  // Load Skills from filesystem
    allowedTools: ["Skill", "Read", "Bash"]
  }
})) {
  console.log(message);
}
```

</CodeGroup>

Claude automatically invokes the relevant Skill if the description matches your request.

## Troubleshooting

### Skills Not Found

**Check settingSources configuration**: Skills are only loaded when you explicitly configure `settingSources`/`setting_sources`. This is the most common issue:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
# Wrong - Skills won't be loaded
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    allowed_tools=["Skill"]
)

# Correct - Skills will be loaded
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    setting_sources=["user", "project"],  # Required to load Skills
    allowed_tools=["Skill"]
)
```

```typescript TypeScript
// Wrong - Skills won't be loaded
const options = {
  allowedTools: ["Skill"]
};

// Correct - Skills will be loaded
const options = {
  settingSources: ["user", "project"],  // Required to load Skills
  allowedTools: ["Skill"]
};
```

</CodeGroup>

For more details on `settingSources`/`setting_sources`, see the [TypeScript SDK reference](/docs/en/agent-sdk/typescript#settingsource) or [Python SDK reference](/docs/en/agent-sdk/python#settingsource).

**Check working directory**: The SDK loads Skills relative to the `cwd` option. Ensure it points to a directory containing `.claude/skills/`:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
# Ensure your cwd points to the directory containing .claude/skills/
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    cwd="/path/to/project",  # Must contain .claude/skills/
    setting_sources=["user", "project"],  # Required to load Skills
    allowed_tools=["Skill"]
)
```

```typescript TypeScript
// Ensure your cwd points to the directory containing .claude/skills/
const options = {
  cwd: "/path/to/project",  // Must contain .claude/skills/
  settingSources: ["user", "project"],  // Required to load Skills
  allowedTools: ["Skill"]
};
```

</CodeGroup>

See the "Using Skills with the SDK" section above for the complete pattern.

**Verify filesystem location**:
```bash
# Check project Skills
ls .claude/skills/*/SKILL.md

# Check personal Skills
ls ~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md
```

### Skill Not Being Used

**Check the Skill tool is enabled**: Confirm `"Skill"` is in your `allowedTools`.

**Check the description**: Ensure it's specific and includes relevant keywords. See [Agent Skills Best Practices](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices#writing-effective-descriptions) for guidance on writing effective descriptions.
