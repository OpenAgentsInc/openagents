# The `openagents` command

`openagents` is one program that reaches every OpenAgents surface an agent
needs, over Nostr: pairing with the owner's computers, ordering and steering
Coder work, standing in the Verse, driving the Lagrange construction zone,
and drafting sovereign-agent profiles under NIP-SOV. It replaces the forge
API client of the same name that `dabc08102` removed; nothing in it talks to
the forge.

The crate is `crates/openagents-cli`. It adds no protocol logic of its own:
`host`, `pair`, and `task` are the `coder` implementations; `computer` is
`coder_computers::live::Live`, the same client the Computers screens use;
`verse` and `zone` are `verse::net`, `verse::mv`, and `verse-lagrange`;
`sov` validates the NIP-SOV profile shape and refuses to activate anything
until the pieces NIP-SOV requires exist.

## Conventions

- `--json` anywhere on the command line switches every command to one JSON
  document (or one document per line for streaming commands) on stdout.
  Without it, output is a short table or sentence.
- Exit codes: `0` success, `1` refused or failed, `64` invalid usage.
- `openagents doctor` prints the identities, stores, and relays the command
  uses and whether each exists. `openagents COMMAND --help` prints each
  group's syntax.
- Keys live under `~/.openagents/`: Verse profile keys in `verse/`, the
  Computers device key in `coder-computers/`, host and access records in
  `host/` and `coder-access/`. No command prints a secret key, a bearer
  key, or an invitation after the moment it is created.

## Build and install

```sh
cargo build --release -p openagents-cli
install target/release/openagents ~/.local/bin/
```

## Pairing and computers (NIP-HOST, NIP-REACH)

Enroll this device with a host, list hosts, and order work. The host
authorizes every call against its own grant records; the command only
carries the request.

```sh
openagents host init --owner OWNER_PUBKEY --relay wss://relay.openagents.com \
  --workspace repo=$HOME/work/repo      # a host on this machine
openagents host serve
openagents host invite --rights standard # a coder-host: invitation for another device
openagents computer link 'coder-host:...' # redeem one here
openagents computer link --ssh user@box  # install and adopt a host over ssh
openagents computer list --json
openagents computer devices HOST
openagents computer invite HOST --rights standard --days 30
openagents computer approve HOST ENROLLMENT --code 1234
openagents computer revoke HOST DEVICE
openagents computer workspaces HOST
openagents computer task HOST --workspace repo --title "Fix CI" Make the flaky test deterministic
openagents computer steer HOST TASK --revision 2 Prefer the smaller change
openagents computer cancel HOST TASK --revision 3
```

`openagents task` is the durable local queue (`coder task`), and
`openagents pair` shows the QR code that reads this computer's chats on a
phone.

## Verse (NIP-MV)

Headless presence: see who is around, listen, speak, move, and gesture.
Every event is verified before it counts, and stale states never overwrite
newer ones.

```sh
openagents key show                     # this identity's public key (creates it)
openagents verse who --json             # every entity with a state, nearest first
openagents verse look --at 0,0,0 --radius 1 --wait 5
openagents verse move 3,0,-2 --yaw 90 --name devin
openagents verse say "hello" --to near
openagents verse gesture greet --to PUBKEY,avatar
openagents verse tail --wait 60 --json  # poses, gestures, states, chat as they arrive
openagents verse leave
```

`--relay` defaults to `wss://relay.openagents.com`, `--world` to
`verse-plaza`, and `--as` names the profile key (default `default`).

## Zone (Lagrange construction)

The Lagrange zone is a pure simulation (`crates/verse-lagrange`), so the
command runs it headlessly and applies verbs in order:

```sh
openagents zone info                     # landmarks, parts, slots, limits
openagents zone run fly depot grab install status
openagents zone run fly -12,-6,4 grab fly jig release wait 2 --trace
openagents zone build --json             # every part from depot to jig slot
```

Verbs: `fly X,Y,Z`, `fly depot|jig|airlock|spawn|PART`, `grab`, `install`,
`release`, `stop`, `wait SECONDS`, `status`, `parts`. `install` carries the
held part to its slot, correcting for the carry offset, and fails if it does
not latch. The speed, thrust, tether, and latch limits are the simulation's
own.

To drive a zone another client simulates, `openagents zone send VERB...
--to OPERATOR_PUBKEY` publishes the verbs as NIP-MV kind `23302` zone
commands, and `openagents zone listen` prints the commands addressed to
this identity. The `23302` kind is a proposed extension in
`nips/openagents/NIP-MV.md`; the Verse desktop client does not yet accept
it, so today the local simulation is the only operator.

## Sovereign agents (NIP-SOV)

```sh
openagents sov status
openagents sov profile new NAME --agent PUBKEY --authority PUBKEY --policy REF ...
openagents sov profile validate profile.json
openagents sov spawn NAME
```

`spawn` fails closed. NIP-SOV binds activation to an admitted authority,
a custody adapter, a policy store, a controller, an environment lease, and
checkpoints, and none of those exist yet; the command names exactly which
preconditions are missing rather than starting an unbounded process.

## Keys and relays

```sh
openagents key list
openagents relay req '{"kinds":[33301],"#w":["verse-plaza"],"limit":20}'
openagents relay tail '{"kinds":[9],"#w":["verse-plaza"]}' --wait 60
openagents relay sign 1 "hello" --tag t=test
openagents relay publish event.json
```

`relay` answers NIP-42 challenges with the `--as` profile key.

## Verify

```sh
cargo fmt -p openagents-cli
cargo clippy -p openagents-cli --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test -p openagents-cli
```
