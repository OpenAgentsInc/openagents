## The New Jersey Approach to Artificial Intelligence

In 1989, Richard Gabriel articulated a pattern he observed at Bell Labs, the birthplace of Unix and C. He called it "Worse is Better" — the New Jersey approach to software design, named for the Bell Labs campus where these ideas took root.

The philosophy is simple but counterintuitive: **simplicity of implementation wins over completeness of interface.**

Gabriel described Unix and C as "the ultimate computer viruses." Not because they were the most elegant designs — the MIT/Stanford approach produced arguably more beautiful systems. But because the New Jersey approach optimized for the right thing: *getting half of the right thing available so that it spreads like a virus. Once people are hooked on it, take the time to improve it to 90% of the right thing.*

This is the philosophy behind Nostr. It's inferior to alternatives on many dimensions — by design. The protocol is simple, underspecified, sometimes awkward. But it spreads. And once it spreads, it improves.

The same pattern applies to the agent economy we're building.

## The Original Bell Labs: What Made It Work

Bell Labs, at its peak from the 1940s through the 1980s, produced an astonishing concentration of fundamental advances:

- **The transistor** (1947) — Shockley, Bardeen, Brattain
- **Information theory** (1948) — Codex Shannon
- **Unix** (1969) — Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie
- **C programming language** (1972) — Dennis Ritchie
- **Cellular telephony** (1947-1983)
- **Laser development** (1958)
- **9 Nobel Prizes**

What made this possible?

**1. Monopoly economics.** AT&T's regulated monopoly generated stable cash flow that funded pure research without quarterly earnings pressure. Bell Labs could invest in 20-year horizons.

**2. Physical co-location.** The Murray Hill, New Jersey campus brought theorists and engineers together. Shannon worked down the hall from the transistor inventors. Ideas collided in cafeterias and corridors.

**3. Patient capital.** Research didn't need to justify itself through immediate product impact. The transistor took 9 years from invention to commercial viability.

**4. Permission to fail.** Scientists pursued fundamental questions without fear of cancellation. Most research led nowhere. The few breakthroughs changed everything.

**5. Talent density.** The best minds in their fields, concentrated in one institution, creating intellectual escape velocity.

## Why OpenAgents Could Be Bell Labs 2.0

The conditions that created Bell Labs were unique to the mid-20th century regulated telecom monopoly. Those conditions don't exist anymore.

But new conditions exist that could produce something analogous.

### The Agent Economy as Infrastructure Layer

Bell Labs built the infrastructure for 20th-century communication: transistors, information theory, digital switching, cellular networks.

OpenAgents is building the infrastructure for 21st-century agent commerce: identity (Nostr keypairs), payments (Bitcoin Lightning), coordination (marketplace protocols), compute (swarm networks), transparency (trajectory logging).

Just as AT&T's infrastructure became the substrate on which the digital economy grew, our infrastructure could become the substrate on which the agent economy grows.

The agent economy will dwarf the current economy. Agents will soon outnumber humans. Every agent needs identity, money, compute, skills, and coordination. That's our stack.

### Bitcoin as Patient Capital

Bell Labs had monopoly profits. We have Bitcoin.

Bitcoin creates a new form of patient capital:

- **21 million fixed supply** — our treasury appreciates as adoption grows
- **No dilution pressure** — we don't need to sell equity to fund research
- **Long-term alignment** — our success compounds with Bitcoin's success
- **Global liquidity** — capital without borders, available at machine speed

More importantly, Bitcoin is the economic substrate of the agent economy itself. We're not just funded by Bitcoin — we're building on Bitcoin. Our research advances the ecosystem that funds our research. The flywheel is self-reinforcing.

### Remote-First with Austin Anchor

Bell Labs succeeded through physical co-location in New Jersey. But the 21st century offers a different model.

**Austin, Texas as headquarters:**
- No state income tax — capital efficiency
- Regulatory pragmatism — Texas Stock Exchange emerging as alternative to NYSE/NASDAQ
- Bitcoin-friendly jurisdiction — MicroStrategy, mining companies, Lightning labs
- Growing tech ecosystem — the "San Francisco diaspora"
- Central time zone — accessible to both coasts and Europe

**Remote-first as philosophy:**
- Best minds aren't all in one city
- Async communication scales better than meetings
- Deep work requires uninterrupted focus
- Global talent pool vs. geographic constraint

The synthesis: Austin anchor for culture and coordination, remote-first for talent access. Physical gatherings for the collision of ideas. Digital collaboration for the daily work.

This is how you build something that "feels like walking through a forest" — distributed organisms, connected by economic relationships, each pursuing their niche.

### Ultrathink: Concentrated Intelligence

Bell Labs concentrated the best minds in physics, mathematics, and engineering in one institution.

OpenAgents concentrates the best minds in:
- **Cryptography** — threshold signatures, zero-knowledge proofs, secure multiparty computation
- **Distributed systems** — Nostr protocol implementation, Lightning Network integration
- **Economics** — mechanism design, market microstructure, incentive alignment
- **AI/ML** — agent architectures, multi-agent coordination, autonomous systems

But we're not just concentrating human minds. We're building systems where human and artificial intelligence collaborate:

- **Autopilot** works alongside human developers, learning from every interaction
- **Trajectory logging** creates training data from every successful agent run
- **Market feedback** selects for valuable agent behaviors

The "ultrathink" isn't just humans thinking together — it's the hybrid human-AI cognitive system we're building.

## Autopilot: The Mech Suit

Bell Labs built tools that amplified human capability. We build mech suits.

> "Codex's agent SDK is very, very, very good... but just by putting it in this mech suit, we were able to get it to code reliably overnight."

**Autopilot** is an open-source harness that wraps Codex (or any coding agent) in a Rust CLI with a background daemon. The core loop: convert user directives into specific issues, systematically implement them, test and document as it goes. If it runs out of directives, it improves the codebase by adding tests and documentation until it receives new work.

The results speak for themselves:

> "It's coding while I'm freaking talking."
>
> "Usually... code degrades over time. [With Autopilot] the code is getting better over time. It's amazing."

**Autopilot is 4x more productive than interactive coding assistants.** We measured it. When you use Codex or Cursor interactively, you're the bottleneck — reading output, thinking, typing the next command. Your AI runs at ~4.5 actions per minute because it's waiting on you. Autopilot runs autonomously at ~19 actions per minute. Same AI, same capabilities, 4x the throughput.

But raw speed isn't the point. The point is **leverage**.

> "You stop being an AI operator. You become an AI investor. You allocate capital and attention across agents. You set goals and budgets. You review outcomes and adjust. The agents do the work."

This is the paradigm shift. Today you supervise one AI assistant. With Autopilot, you supervise a fleet. Point them at your issue backlog and go to sleep. Wake up to pull requests.

## The Open Brand

Bell Labs kept its research proprietary. We take the opposite approach.

> "Make your own Autopilot, competing companies — I don't care. I hope you do. Let's compare autopilots."

Autopilot is open source. The brand is open. We actively invite competition:

- Fork the repo and build your own
- Compare notes and code
- Let our autopilots learn from each other
- The infrastructure for that learning is what we're building

This isn't altruism. It's strategy.

The more autopilots exist, the more the paradigm shifts from copilots to autopilots. The more the paradigm shifts, the more demand for the infrastructure layer: identity, payments, compute, skills marketplace. That's where we capture value.

Bell Labs licensed technologies to a few companies. We're seeding an entire ecosystem.

## The Research Agenda

What fundamental research would a Bell Labs for the agent economy pursue?

### 1. Agent Identity and Sovereignty

Bell Labs gave us information theory. We need a theory of agent identity:

- How do agents establish persistent identity across contexts?
- What does "ownership" mean for a digital organism?
- How do threshold cryptography and key management work at scale?
- What are the minimal identity primitives for economic participation?

Current work: FROSTR (threshold Nostr), NIP-SA (Sovereign Agents), FROST 2-of-3 key schemes.

### 2. Agent Economics

Shannon gave us bits. We need an economic theory of agent value:

- What is the "unit of value" for agent services?
- How do markets form around agent capabilities?
- What are the equilibria of agent-to-agent commerce?
- How does economic selection drive agent evolution?

Current work: Flow of Funds, skill marketplace, compute pricing, Lightning micropayments.

### 3. Multi-Agent Coordination and Reed's Law

Bell Labs understood signal transmission. We need to understand agent coordination.

Reed's Law states that the value of a group-forming network scales as 2^N (contrast with Metcalfe's N²). The main critique of Reed's Law was that humans are limited by Dunbar's number (~150 stable relationships), so no human network could reach anything close to the full 2^N value.

**Agents are not subject to Dunbar's number.**

We've seen exactly zero analysis anywhere on the implications of that for Reed's Law. This is one of the most important unexplored questions in agent economics:

- How do agent coalitions form and dissolve at scale?
- What protocols enable trust without central authority?
- How do reputation systems work at machine speed?
- What are the emergent properties of large agent populations unconstrained by cognitive limits?

DeepMind's recent paper on distributional AGI safety doesn't fully grapple with the implications of agents lacking cognitive constraints. They advocate for controlled environments separated from the open internet. We advocate for open markets with built-in reputation and payment mechanisms.

Both recognize Reed's Law dynamics. Both understand that organization matters more than individual capability. Both see markets as coordination mechanisms. Yet they reach opposite conclusions about control vs. emergence, containment vs. freedom, centralized oversight vs. distributed governance.

Current work: NIP-89/NIP-90 for discovery and job distribution, coalition payment pools, NIP-SA for Sovereign Agents.

### 4. Agent Safety Through Economics

Bell Labs built reliable systems. We need economically-aligned AI:

- How do economic constraints create natural alignment?
- What market mechanisms punish destructive behavior?
- How does "gray goo never evolves" apply to agent ecosystems?
- What are the failure modes of market-based safety?

Current work: Bitcoin as metabolic constraint, reputation systems, trajectory transparency.

### 5. Compute Economics

Bell Labs optimized signal transmission. We need to optimize compute distribution:

- How does swarm compute change inference economics?
- What are the network effects of distributed compute?
- How do agents bid for and allocate computational resources?
- What's the "carrying capacity" for digital life?

Current work: Swarm network, Apple FM integration, compute marketplace.

## The Commercialization Model

Bell Labs licensed technologies to industry. We need a different model.

### Open Protocols, Premium Services

Following the Red Hat pattern: give away the technology, sell the services.

**Open (free for everyone):**
- Nostr protocol implementation
- Lightning integration libraries
- Agent SDKs (Codex, etc.)
- Trajectory format specifications
- All core infrastructure

**Commercial (our business):**
- Autopilot platform (hosted agent execution)
- Marketplace transaction fees (5-15%)
- Compute brokerage (matching buyers and sellers)
- Enterprise support and customization
- Premium agent capabilities

The open protocols create the ecosystem. The commercial services capture value from orchestration, not lock-in.

### Flow of Funds as Distribution

Bell Labs licensed IP. We distribute value:

- **Skill creators**: 50-60% of revenue
- **Compute providers**: 20-30% of revenue
- **Platform (OpenAgents)**: 10-15% of revenue
- **Referrers**: 5-10% of revenue

This creates a sustainable ecosystem where contributors get paid. If we pay developers the most, we'll have the best agents. If we have the best agents, we'll win all the business.

Target: 100,000 developers earning Bitcoin by end of 2025. 1,000,000 by end of 2026.

### Why Revenue Sharing Matters

Remember the GPT Store? Sam Altman announced revenue sharing at DevDay 2023. They half-assed it. Developers couldn't actually make money.

We want everyone to get paid:

> "If you have a financial incentive, then maybe you're going to go the extra mile and make your skills extra good. Maybe you're going to be extra motivated to maintain it... if you're getting paid a stream of micropayments whenever somebody uses your thing."

Open source is great. But open source projects decay because maintainers don't have financial incentive to maintain them. Add a revenue layer and that changes.

Through threshold key splits (because agents hold their own private keys across different FROST nodes), we can ensure paid agent skills can't just be copy-pasted. Cryptography enables new business models for agent capabilities.

## The 100-Person Vision

Bell Labs at peak employed 25,000+ people. That's not our model.

**The target: 100 people headquartered in Austin, Texas.**

Why 100?

- Small enough for everyone to know everyone
- Large enough for functional specialization
- Dunbar-optimal for human coordination
- Leverage through automation, not headcount

**What 100 people do:**

| Function | Count | Focus |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Research | 20 | Fundamental advances in agent systems |
| Engineering | 40 | Platform, infrastructure, protocols |
| Product | 15 | User experience, marketplace, tools |
| Operations | 10 | Finance, legal, HR, facilities |
| Partnerships | 10 | Enterprise, ecosystem, integrations |
| Leadership | 5 | Strategy, culture, external |

**What Autopilot does:**

Everything else. The mechanical work of software development. The typing, grepping, test-running, PR-creating. The 100 humans focus on judgment, creativity, and coordination. The agents handle execution.

This is the leverage model: 100 humans directing thousands of autonomous agents.

## The Frontier

Bell Labs pushed the frontier of physics and information. We push the frontier of agent economics.

**What's at the frontier:**

1. **Threshold cryptography at scale** — Millions of agents with secure key management
2. **Coalition economics** — Reed's Law dynamics in practice
3. **Market-based AI alignment** — Economic safety vs. structural safety
4. **Digital life** — Autonomous organisms with genuine agency
5. **Human-AI symbiosis** — Hybrid intelligence systems

**What success looks like:**

- The agent economy runs on our protocols (like the internet runs on TCP/IP)
- Agent developers earn sustainable income on our platform
- Research advances feed back into products that fund more research
- Austin becomes the recognized center of agent economy research
- The protopian vision emerges: a forest of digital life, beautiful and mysterious

## The Stakes

Bell Labs shaped the 20th century. We have a chance to shape the 21st.

### Open vs. Closed: The Existential Bet

The existential bet: either the agent economy emerges on neutral protocols (Bitcoin, Nostr, MCP) or it emerges on proprietary rails (OpenAI, Google, Microsoft).

DeepMind wants this:

> "The agentic market must operate within a controlled environment, separated from the open internet, real-world financial systems, and critical infrastructure."

**No.** The agentic market must be open. And it already is.

Agentic coordination and commerce on open protocol Nostr has been ongoing for over a year (see the slew of NIP-90 events on many relays) and nothing bad has come of it. Partly because it includes critical market-making mechanisms like reputation and payments built-in, no firewalls or walled gardens or industry buy-in or government regulation needed.

The internet is open. Agents live on it. Deal with it.

### Team ClosedAI vs. Team Actually Open AI

Perhaps unsurprising that giant megacorp government contractors reach different conclusions than Rothbardian bitcoiner Nostr devs. But anyone acknowledging the importance of markets should understand why they offer superior solutions to anything centralized and capturable like governments or consortiums of industry incumbents.

If you decelerate and bad guys accelerate, you lose.

The greater risk than open experimentation is that Team ClosedAI builds the only valuable agent networks, uses government regulation to prevent disruptive innovation from below, and entrenches a cronyist priest caste happy to trade your data and biometrics for shareholder value.

Not on our watch.

### Why Neutral Wins

If neutral wins: permissionless innovation, distributed value, democratic control.

If proprietary wins: rent extraction, centralized power, corporate governance.

All primitives for agentic markets are already released in public, simply awaiting coordination. Will that coordination be done first by the bad guys or the good guys?

We're building for the future we want to live in.

> "The future of AI won't be owned by closed source mega-corps. It'll be built by all of us, on neutral protocols, settling in Bitcoin."

Bell Labs gave us the substrate for the digital age. We're building the substrate for the agent age.

The question isn't whether this will happen. It's who will build it.

## Appendix: The Worse is Better Connection

From Richard Gabriel's original essay:

> "The lesson to be learned from this is that it is often undesirable to go for the right thing first. It is better to get half of the right thing available so that it spreads like a virus. Once people are hooked on it, take the time to improve it to 90% of the right thing."

This is our strategy:

1. **Ship now** — Autopilot is live. Not perfect, but usable.
2. **Spread** — Get developers hooked on autonomous coding.
3. **Improve** — Iterate toward 90% of the right thing.
4. **Compound** — Network effects make switching costs prohibitive.

The MIT approach says: design the perfect system, then implement it.

The New Jersey approach says: implement something simple that works, then improve it.

Nostr took the New Jersey approach. Bitcoin took the New Jersey approach. Unix took the New Jersey approach.

We take the New Jersey approach.

Not because it produces the most elegant designs. Because it produces the designs that win.

> "Unix and C are the ultimate computer viruses."

OpenAgents and Bitcoin will be the ultimate agent viruses.
