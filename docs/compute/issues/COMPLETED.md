# OpenAgents Compute Marketplace Issues - Completion Summary

**Created**: 2025-11-07
**Status**: 19 comprehensive issues completed (16 original + 3 new Spark SDK issues - 1 deleted)
**Key Changes**:
- **nostr-sdk-ios fork** (Phase 1 optimization - issue #001)
- **Spark SDK integration** (Phase 2 redesign - replaced manual Lightning)
**Ready for**: User review → GitHub publishing

## Overview

Created **19 comprehensive GitHub issues** (out of 31 planned) covering the critical path for OpenAgents compute marketplace implementation. Each issue includes full technical specifications, Apple compliance analysis, testing requirements, and implementation guidance.

**Major Decisions**:
1. **nostr-sdk-ios fork** (Phase 1): Use OpenAgents fork of nostr-sdk-ios instead of building Nostr from scratch. Reduces issue #001 effort by ~40% (4-6w → 2-3w) while leveraging 25+ NIPs already implemented.
2. **Spark SDK** (Phase 2): Switched from manual Lightning implementation to Breez Spark SDK, reducing Phase 2 effort by ~35-40% while improving UX and reliability.

## nostr-sdk-ios Fork Decision

### Why Fork nostr-sdk-ios?

**Rationale**:
- ✅ **Stale upstream**: Official SDK hasn't had a release since February 2025 (9 months ago)
- ✅ **25+ NIPs implemented**: Core protocol (NIP-01), relay management, encryption (NIP-04, NIP-44), bech32 (NIP-19) already done
- ✅ **Effort reduction**: ~40% reduction in issue #001 (4-6w → 2-3w)
- ✅ **Rapid iteration**: Add marketplace NIPs without waiting for upstream merge approvals
- ✅ **Shallow fork**: Only ~850 LOC additions to add NIP-57 (Zaps), NIP-89 (Handlers), NIP-90 (DVM)

**What Changed**:
- **✏️ Updated**: Issue #001 (Nostr Client Library) - **2-3 weeks saved**
  - From: "Build comprehensive Nostr library from scratch" (4-6 weeks)
  - To: "Integrate nostr-sdk-ios fork and add marketplace NIPs" (2-3 weeks)
- What's already implemented: RelayPool, NostrEvent, EventKind, Filter, encryption, signatures
- What to add: ZapRequestEvent, ZapReceiptEvent, DVMJobRequestEvent, DVMJobResultEvent, etc.

## Spark SDK Integration Decision

### Why Spark SDK?

**User Directive**:
> "I want you to think deeply and make a plan for how to integrate Bitcoin and Spark into our compute plan. Note that we're not going to be manually implementing Bolt 11 or some of the stuff you suggested. We're going to basically use Spark via Breez for all of our Bitcoin and Lightning stuff."

**Technical Benefits**:
- ✅ **Production-ready SDK**: Breez maintains the SDK, node infrastructure, and LSP (no manual Lightning protocol work)
- ✅ **Nodeless operation**: Users don't need to manage Lightning channels or liquidity
- ✅ **Better UX**: Offline receive, instant sends, automatic backups
- ✅ **Effort reduction**: ~35-40% reduction in Phase 2 effort (BOLT11 manual work eliminated)
- ✅ **Code sharing**: SparkWalletManager shared between iOS and macOS (reduces duplication)

**What Changed**:
- **❌ Deleted**: Issue #003 (BOLT11 & Lightning Primitives) - **2-3 weeks saved**
- **✏️ Rewrote**: Issues #010, #013 (iOS/macOS Wallets) - simplified with Spark SDK
- **🆕 Created**:
  - Issue #012 (API Key Config) - 2-3 days
  - Issue #015 (Payment Coordinator) - 1-2 weeks
  - Issue #016 (Seed Backup/Recovery) - 3-5 days

**Architecture**:
- Spark is **NOT Lightning** - it's a Layer 2 Bitcoin protocol using statechain technology
- Threshold signatures (FROST): user holds one key, Spark Operators hold another
- Self-custodial: users always control Bitcoin, can exit to L1 anytime
- Pre-signed timelocked exit transactions ensure safety
- Complete BOLT11 support (send/receive Lightning invoices)

**For Full Details**: See `docs/compute/issues/SPARK-SDK-INTEGRATION.md`

```bash
# For each approved issue:
cd docs/compute/issues/phase-1-mvp
gh issue create \

## Key Insights

### Architecture (From apple-terms-research.md)

**What We're Building**:
- **iOS**: Coordination + wallet + agent management (NO compute)
- **macOS**: Worker runtime (FM + MLX + Ollama)
- **Nostr**: Decentralized marketplace (NIP-90 + NIP-57)
- **Lightning**: Micropayments (BOLT11 invoices, zaps)
- **Open**: Any client can join liquidity pool

**Why This Architecture**:
- ✅ **Apple compliant**: iOS doesn't run background workers
- ✅ **Privacy**: On-device compute (Foundation Models, MLX)
- ✅ **Decentralized**: No OpenAgents server required
- ✅ **Interoperable**: Open protocols (Nostr, Lightning, NIP-90)

### Critical Dependencies

```
Crypto (002) → Nostr (001) → Everything Else
                ↓
            Wallet (010) → Payments (012, 013)
                ↓
            Worker (007) → Backends (017, 020)
                ↓
            Policy (009) → AUP Enforcement
```

### Apple Compliance (All Issues Addressed)

**App Store Review Guidelines**:
- ✅ ASRG 2.4.2: No background mining (iOS = coordination only)
- ✅ ASRG 2.5.2: No downloaded code (Nostr events = data)
- ✅ ASRG 2.5.4: Background limits (no ambient workers)
- ✅ ASRG 3.1.1/3.1.3: Payment flows (IAP vs non-IAP)
- ✅ ASRG 3.1.5(i): Crypto wallets (Organization developer)

**DPLA & Foundation Models AUP**:
- ✅ Policy Module (issue #009) enforces AUP
- ❌ Prohibited: Healthcare/legal/finance, academic textbooks
- ✅ Allowed: Summarization, code gen, Q&A (non-regulated)

## Recommendation

**For MVP (All critical issues complete)**:
1. ✅ Review Phase 1 issues (001-009, minus deleted #003) - **Foundation complete**
2. ✅ Review Phase 2 Spark SDK integration (010, 012, 013, 015, 016) - **Payment system complete**
3. ✅ Review Spark SDK integration plan (`SPARK-SDK-INTEGRATION.md`)
4. 🚀 **Ready to implement**: All critical path issues specified and ready

**Timeline**: ~14-18 weeks for Phases 1-3 with 3 engineers → Full marketplace with multi-backend support

**Next Steps**:
1. User approval of all 19 issues + Spark SDK integration
2. Publish approved issues to GitHub
3. Create milestones (Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3)
4. Assign engineers and begin implementation
