# Container Thoughts: Scaling Psionic to 5 Million Deployments

After analyzing Psionic's architecture, deployment patterns, and hypermedia-first design philosophy, this document explores containerization strategies for massive scale deployment scenarios. The goal: understand how to efficiently host 5 million Psionic applications on shared VPS infrastructure while maintaining isolation, security, and performance.

## The Scale Challenge: 5 Million Psionic Apps

Hosting 5 million Psionic applications presents unprecedented challenges that traditional containerization approaches cannot efficiently address. Each Psionic app requires:

- **Bun runtime environment** (50-100MB per instance)
- **WebSocket relay connectivity** (persistent connections)
- **File system access** for markdown processing and static assets
- **Database connections** (SQLite for small apps, PostgreSQL for larger ones)
- **Memory footprint** (25-50% higher than Node.js equivalents)

Traditional Docker containers would consume 250-500GB of memory just for runtime overhead at this scale, making the economics impossible. We need fundamentally different approaches.

## Firecracker VM Lessons: Micro-virtualization at Scale

AWS Lambda's Firecracker VM provides crucial insights for our architecture. Firecracker achieves:

- **125ms cold start times** for full VMs
- **5MB memory overhead** per microVM
- **Process-level isolation** with VM-level security
- **Snapshots and cloning** for rapid deployment

Key learnings for Psionic containers:

1. **Memory-mapped snapshots** could enable instant Psionic app cloning
2. **Copy-on-write file systems** reduce storage overhead for identical Bun runtimes
3. **Lightweight hypervisor** approach provides better isolation than containers
4. **Event-driven scaling** matches Psionic's hypermedia request patterns

## Research Questions for Container System Development

### Isolation and Security Architecture

How can we implement **namespace-based isolation** that provides security guarantees without full VM overhead? Research areas:

- **Linux namespaces** (PID, mount, network, user) for process isolation
- **cgroups v2** for resource limiting and monitoring
- **seccomp-bfd** for syscall filtering and attack surface reduction
- **User namespace mapping** for privilege separation without root

What isolation boundaries are **actually necessary** for Psionic applications? Consider:

- Do Psionic apps need separate network namespaces if they use WebSocket relays?
- Can filesystem isolation be achieved through chroot jails for markdown content?
- How do we handle shared databases while maintaining application isolation?

### Resource Sharing and Optimization

How can we implement **runtime deduplication** for Bun processes across thousands of applications?

- **Shared memory segments** for Bun runtime code
- **Copy-on-write process forking** from master Bun processes
- **Memory-mapped file sharing** for common dependencies
- **Dynamic library sharing** across container boundaries

What level of **resource pooling** is optimal for WebSocket connections?

- Connection multiplexing across multiple Psionic apps
- Shared relay infrastructure with per-app message routing
- Connection pooling for database access patterns
- Load balancing strategies for hypermedia request distribution

### Storage and Persistence Strategy

How do we handle **persistent storage** for 5 million applications efficiently?

- **Distributed file systems** (GlusterFS, CephFS) vs local storage
- **Content-addressable storage** for deduplicating static assets
- **Snapshot-based backups** using btrfs or ZFS copy-on-write
- **Tiered storage** (SSD for active apps, HDD for dormant ones)

What **markdown processing optimizations** can be shared across applications?

- Pre-compiled markdown parsers in shared memory
- Cached rendering pipelines for common markdown patterns
- Shared syntax highlighting and component libraries
- Template compilation and caching strategies

### Network Architecture and Scaling

How do we implement **efficient reverse proxy** for millions of Psionic applications?

- **HAProxy/Nginx** configuration for massive virtual host routing
- **DNS-based routing** vs header-based vs SNI-based routing
- **SSL/TLS termination** strategies at scale
- **WebSocket connection persistence** across container restarts

What **network topology** optimizes for hypermedia request patterns?

- Regional clustering for latency optimization
- Content delivery network integration for static assets
- WebSocket relay infrastructure design and federation
- Cross-application communication patterns and security

## Container System Architecture Options

**Architecture**: Lightweight process isolation using Linux primitives

**Advantages**:
- Native Linux tooling and management
- Excellent resource control and monitoring
- Low overhead for resource allocation
- Well-understood security model

**Challenges**:
- Weaker isolation guarantees than VMs
- Shared kernel vulnerabilities affect all processes

## Shared Hosting VPS Economics

### Resource Allocation Models

**Dense Packing Strategy**: Maximize applications per server
