Restored placeholder for docs/convex/README.md

Context
- This directory was previously present locally but untracked. Its contents were removed during a local cleanup. Since it was never committed, git history cannot recover it.
- This placeholder recreates the directory and filenames we know existed so other agents can restore content.

What to add back
- Overview of local/self-hosted Convex setup
- How the bridge manages Convex (ports, DB paths, health checks)
- App wiring and subscriptions
- One-time function deploy instructions and `.env.local` guidance

Please replace this file with the original content when available.
