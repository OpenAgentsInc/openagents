# Convex Docs

This folder groups all Convex docs for the OpenAgents project: setup, design notes, audits, and integration details.

Contents
- `bridge-setup.md` — How the Convex backend starts and becomes ready when running `npx tricoder`.
- `convex.md` — Integration overview (local backend, app wiring, why Convex).
- `sidecar.md` — Tauri sidecar notes for bundling a backend with the desktop app.
- `integration-audit.md` — Design/audit write‑up.
- `projects-and-skills.md` — Projects/Skills modeling and mirroring plan.

If you were linked here from the old paths, files have moved from `docs/` root to `docs/convex/`.
