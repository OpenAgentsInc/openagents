# Coder Desktop patches

Keep fork-specific changes here so upstream updates can review each integration.

- [OpenAgents #11836](https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/openagents/issues/11836):
  Add Coder Light and Coder Noir to `zeron-theme`, make them the default light
  and dark selections, and use them when a selected theme is missing. Map the
  public `oa-tokens` palette snapshot in `crates/theme/src/builtins.rs`; no
  sibling checkout is needed. Preserve upstream themes and saved preferences.
  See [the theme system](theme-system.md) for the source revision.
