# Effect Native — A Framework for Building Native Applications Using Effect

Date: 2026-07-08
Status: framing decision (owner-directed). This is the definitive statement
of what Effect Native *is*, correcting the earlier, too-shallow "UI library /
UI substrate" language. Grounded in a deep read of Effect v4
(`projects/repos/effect-smol`, `effect@4.0.0-beta.94`) and React Native
(`projects/repos/react-native`) on 2026-07-08. It sits above the other docs
in this folder and recontextualizes them.

## 1. The one-line definition

React Native describes itself as **"a framework for building native
applications using React."** Effect Native is the exact same sentence with
one word changed:

> **Effect Native is a framework for building native applications using
> Effect.**

That is not wordplay. It is a precise architectural claim: where React
Native takes React — a model for describing UI and state — and runs it
against native platforms, Effect Native takes **Effect** — a model for
describing *entire programs* (state, effects, concurrency, data, services,
resource lifetimes, and UI) — and runs it against native platforms. The UI
is one part of an Effect Native application; the rest of the app *is Effect*.

The base is **Effect v4** — the `effect-smol` rewrite (`4.0.0-beta.94`): a
re-architected fiber runtime (~6.3 KB core, ~15 KB with Schema), everything
consolidated into a single `effect` package, and an `unstable/*` module
system. We build on v4, not v3.

## 2. The parallel, precisely

React Native is "React + a native host." React supplies the app-authoring
model (components, hooks, state, context, the reconciler); a per-platform
host (Fabric on iOS/Android) turns that into native views. Effect Native is
"Effect + a native host," and Effect supplies a *far larger* app-authoring
model. Role for role:

| Role | React Native | Effect Native |
|---|---|---|
| **App-authoring model** | React (components, hooks, JSX) | **Effect** (effects as values, `Effect.gen`) |
| **Execution engine** | React Fiber reconciler + scheduler | **Effect fiber runtime** (`Fiber`, `Scheduler`) — inert descriptions the runtime commits |
| **Concurrency** | React concurrent mode (cooperative) | **Structured concurrency** — fibers, supervision, interruption, `Exit` |
| **State** | `useState` / component-local | **`Ref` / `SubscriptionRef` / `Atom`** — fiber-safe, observable |
| **Events / reactive data** | callbacks, event props | **`Stream`** (+ `PubSub`, `Queue`) |
| **Dependency wiring** | React Context / prop-drilling | **`Layer` + `Context.Service`** — a real DI graph, memoized, scoped |
| **Typed data / boundaries** | PropTypes/TS (erasable) | **`Schema`** in core — decode/encode/validate every boundary |
| **Errors** | throw / try-catch / error boundaries | **typed errors in the type** (`Schema.TaggedError`), never thrown |
| **Resource lifetime** | `useEffect` cleanup | **`Scope` / `acquireRelease`** — guaranteed cleanup on `Exit` |
| **Platform host** | Fabric (iOS/Android native) | **`platform-native`** adapter (`NativeRuntime.runMain` + native service Layers) — mirrors `platform-browser`/`-node`/`-bun` |
| **Native painting** | Fabric mounting → UIView/View | **renderer adapters** (RN/Fabric now; Swift/Compose later; DOM on web; canvas via three-effect) |
| **UI description** | JSX component tree | **typed component set** (Schema-typed catalog + typed intents) — the view layer of the Effect app |

Read the table top to bottom and the point lands: React gives React Native a
UI model and a reconciler. Effect gives Effect Native a *whole application
runtime* — concurrency, DI, typed errors, resource safety, streams, schema —
and the UI sits on top of it as one concern among several.

## 3. Why this is a *stronger* foundation than React Native's

React was a UI library that later grew an application model (hooks, context,
state) as an afterthought — and it shows: no typed errors, no dependency
injection, no structured concurrency, no resource-lifetime guarantees, no
built-in typed-data boundary. React Native inherits exactly those gaps at the
app layer, which is why its ecosystem bolts on state libraries, data-fetching
libraries, DI conventions, and error handling per project — the "React slop on
React slop" the Effect Native decision exists to escape.

Effect is the opposite: it was *built* as the application foundation. So
Effect Native inherits, for free, the things RN apps assemble by hand:

- **The runtime is a reconciler-grade scheduler already.** Effects are inert
  descriptions; the fiber runtime commits them, schedules cooperatively
  (`Scheduler.shouldYield`), and enforces structured concurrency and
  interruption. This is the same "declare a description, the runtime commits
  it" mental model as React — we already own the engine.
- **The app is *wired*, not prop-drilled.** `Layer` + `Context.Service` is a
  memoized, scoped dependency graph; an Effect Native app is assembled by
  composing Layers into one root and handing it to the native `runMain` — the
  direct analog of mounting a React root, but for the *whole* app.
- **Every boundary is typed and validated with Schema.** Component props,
  style tokens, the native bridge, persisted state, network payloads — one
  tool (`Schema`, now in core) decodes/encodes/validates them all. This is
  the typed spine that makes 1000 agent edits/day safe.
- **Errors, resources, and state are handled by construction** — typed
  errors, guaranteed cleanup via `Scope`, fiber-safe observable state via
  `SubscriptionRef`/`Atom`. RN leaves all three to the app author.

So "Effect Native" is not "React Native but with Effect sprinkled on." It is a
native application framework whose foundation is categorically more capable
than React Native's — which is the entire reason to build it.

## 4. The technical seam: Effect Native is a platform host adapter

The reframe is not aspirational — Effect already has the exact extension point.
Effect v4's platform packages follow one pattern: **core defines abstract
platform services** (`FileSystem`, `Path`, `Socket`, `Terminal`, HTTP, workers
— as `Layer` requirements), and **a host package provides concrete Layers plus
a `runMain`**:

- `@effect/platform-node` → `NodeRuntime.runMain` + `NodeFileSystem`,
  `NodeHttpServer`, `NodeWorker`, … (SIGINT/SIGTERM interruption).
- `@effect/platform-browser` → `BrowserRuntime.runMain` (interrupts on
  `beforeunload`) + `BrowserHttpClient`, `Geolocation`, `Clipboard`,
  `Permissions`, `IndexedDb`, …
- `@effect/platform-bun` → the Bun equivalents.

**Effect Native is simply the next member of that family: a `platform-native`
adapter** — `NativeRuntime.runMain` for the mobile/native process, native
`FileSystem`/`Path`/`Socket`/secure-storage/notification Layers, and the UI
bridge — plus the renderer(s) that paint the view. That is *exactly* how
React Native relates to React (a host under a shared model), except the shared
model is Effect and the host is ours to write. The pattern is proven three
times over in the repo; we are extending it, not inventing it.

Two pieces already exist that a native renderer consumes:
- **Reactive state → view binding** lives in `effect/unstable/reactivity`
  (`Atom`, `AtomRegistry`, `Reactivity`) and ships as framework bindings today
  (`@effect/atom-react` React hooks, plus Solid and Vue). The pattern for
  "observe Effect state, drive a view" is established; Effect Native adds the
  *native* binding.
- **The runtime entry** (`Effect.runFork`, `makeRunMain`, `ManagedRuntime`
  for foreign call sites) is the seam a native host wraps — the same seam
  `BrowserRuntime`/`NodeRuntime` wrap.

## 5. What an "Effect Native app" is, end to end

One Effect program, run by a native host, painted by renderers:

- **Services** (`Layer` + `Context.Service`) wire the app — the sync client,
  the auth service, the credits client, the CRM client — provided once,
  memoized, scoped.
- **State** lives in `Ref` / `SubscriptionRef` / `Atom` (fiber-safe,
  observable), bound from Khala Sync.
- **Logic and effects** are `Effect.gen` blocks with typed errors and
  structured concurrency — no throwing, no untyped async.
- **Data** at every boundary is `Schema` — decoded from the wire, validated,
  encoded for the native bridge.
- **Events** flow through `Stream` / `PubSub`.
- **The UI** is the typed component set (this folder's other docs): a
  Schema-typed catalog with typed intents (not callbacks), a deterministic
  typed-object styling model, rendered by swappable adapters.
- **Resource lifetimes** are `Scope`-managed; the native `runMain` interrupts
  the root fiber on process teardown, and everything cleans up on `Exit`.

The UI is the last bullet, not the first — because Effect Native is an
*application* framework, and the UI is one of its concerns.

## 6. How this recontextualizes the other docs

- **The main analysis + EN-0…EN-9 roadmap** describes the *UI/renderer layer*
  of this framework — the typed component set and the renderer adapters. It's
  correct; it's just one layer of the whole, and its "runtime" is Effect's
  runtime, its typed contracts are Schema.
- **Foldkit** is the closest prior art: a *whole-app* Effect framework
  (Elm/MVU) — the "framework, not library" instinct, but web-only and
  all-or-nothing. We take its lessons (interactions-as-data, effect taxonomy,
  Ports) into Effect Native's app + UI layers.
- **React Native** is the *renderer* we borrow (Fabric/Yoga) — and the model
  we replace. The positive half of "use the renderer, leave the model" is:
  **Effect is our React.** The app is authored in Effect; RN only paints.
- **three-effect** is a *renderer* (canvas) folding under this framework, and
  a domain library it draws from.
- **Styling** (Tailwind/StyleX) is one typed boundary among many — styles as
  Schema-typed values, lowered per renderer.

## 7. Honest caveats

- **`platform-native` does not exist yet.** The platform-adapter *pattern* is
  proven (browser/node/bun), and RN gives us the native painting engine, but
  the native host Layers + the native reactive-state→view binding are net-new
  work. This is the hard, valuable core.
- **The reactive→view bindings that ship today are for React/Solid/Vue**, not
  a native renderer. Effect Native writes the native one (and the DOM one that
  doesn't drag React along).
- **v4 is beta.** We pin `effect-smol@4.0.0-beta.94` and track it; the core
  programming model (Effect/Layer/Schema/Stream) is stable per the v4 migration
  notes, but the `unstable/*` surface (including reactivity) can move — expect
  it and pin hard.
- **Ambition vs. shipping.** This framing is the *what it is*, not a mandate
  to build all of it before the MVP/Sarah/sales. Greenfield-first and
  migrate-on-touch still govern: build the app-foundation + UI layers where new
  surfaces need them, prove them small (EN-0), and let the product pull the
  rest.

## 8. The corrected description (use this)

Wherever Effect Native was called a "UI library," "UI framework," or "UI
substrate," use instead:

> **Effect Native — a framework for building native applications using
> Effect.**

The UI/component substrate is a *part* of Effect Native, not the whole of it.
The whole of it is: build your entire application — services, state, effects,
concurrency, typed data, and UI — as one Effect program, and run it natively
on any platform.
