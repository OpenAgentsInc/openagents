# Effect-TS Integration Guide

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of Effect-TS integration in the OpenAgents project, serving as a central reference for all Effect-related documentation, issues, and implementation patterns.

## Overview

OpenAgents is undergoing a systematic migration to Effect-TS, a powerful functional programming library that provides:
- **Type-safe error handling** with tagged errors
- **Resource management** with automatic cleanup
- **Streaming capabilities** with built-in backpressure
- **Structured concurrency** using lightweight fibers
- **Software Transactional Memory (STM)** for atomic state updates

## Current Status

- âœ… **Phase 1**: Mobile session sync with Confect foundation (Completed)
- âœ… **Phase 2**: APM & Authentication services (Completed)
- âœ… **Phase 3**: Full Confect integration - Effect-TS + Convex unification (Completed)
- âœ… **Phase 4**: Comprehensive testing coverage (Completed - Issue #1269)
- ðŸ“‹ **Next**: Agent orchestration using Effect's actor model

## Architectural Decisions

### 1. Confect Framework
Using Confect (Effect-TS + Convex) for seamless database integration with:
- Effect Schema validation
- Option types replacing null checks
- Compile-time type safety

### 2. Service Architecture
All Tauri commands wrapped in Effect services:
```typescript
const TauriCommandService = Context.GenericTag<TauriCommandService>("TauriCommandService")
```

### 3. Error Handling
Tagged errors for precise error discrimination:
- `StorageError`, `AuthError`, `APMError`
- `StreamingError`, `ConnectionError`, `MessageParsingError`
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff

### 4. State Management
STM (Software Transactional Memory) for atomic updates:
- Mobile-desktop sync coordination
- Offline-capable state management
- Conflict-free concurrent updates

## Quick Reference

### Common Patterns

**Service Definition**:
```typescript
export class MyService extends Effect.Service<MyService>()('MyService', {
  sync: () => ({ /* methods */ }),
  dependencies: [/* other services */]
}) {}
```

**Error Handling**:
```typescript
Effect.catchTags({
  StorageError: (e) => Effect.fail(new CustomError(e)),
  NetworkError: (e) => Effect.retry(retrySchedule)
})
```

**React Integration**:
```typescript
const useEffectService = () => {
  const runtime = useContext(EffectRuntimeContext)
  // ... hook implementation
}
```

**Streaming**:
```typescript
Stream.fromQueue(queue).pipe(
  Stream.tap(processMessage),
  Stream.runDrain
)
```

## Next Steps

1. âœ… ~~Complete Phase 4 testing coverage~~ (Completed - Issue #1269)
2. Implement agent orchestration patterns using Effect's actor model
3. Apply Effect-TS patterns to remaining services based on established patterns
