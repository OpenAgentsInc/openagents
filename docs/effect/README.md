# Effect-TS Integration Guide

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of Effect-TS integration in the OpenAgents project, serving as a central reference for all Effect-related documentation, issues, and implementation patterns.

## Overview

OpenAgents is undergoing a systematic migration to Effect-TS, a powerful functional programming library that provides:
- **Type-safe error handling** with tagged errors
- **Resource management** with automatic cleanup
- **Streaming capabilities** with built-in backpressure
- **Structured concurrency** using lightweight fibers
- **Software Transactional Memory (STM)** for atomic state updates

## Current Status

- âœ… **Phase 1**: Mobile session sync with Confect foundation (Completed)
- âœ… **Phase 2**: APM & Authentication services (Completed)
- âœ… **Phase 3**: Full Confect integration - Effect-TS + Convex unification (Completed)
- ðŸš§ **Phase 4**: Comprehensive testing coverage (In Progress)
- ðŸ“‹ **Next**: Agent orchestration using Effect's actor model

  - Target: 90%+ unit test coverage
  - Integration testing for cross-service interactions
  - Error scenario and performance testing

### Streaming Architecture
- **[#1159](https://github.com/openagents/openagents/issues/1159)** - Effect-based streaming (CLOSED)
- **[#1164](https://github.com/openagents/openagents/pull/1164)** - Real-time streaming fix (MERGED)
  - Replaced polling with Tauri event streaming
  - Reduced latency from 25ms to <1ms
  - Zero CPU usage when idle
  - Key fix: `Effect.forkDaemon` prevents fiber interruption

### Other Notable PRs
- **[#964](https://github.com/openagents/openagents/pull/964)** - Effect MCP server integration
- **[#1039](https://github.com/openagents/openagents/pull/1039)** - Effect-based Psionic features
- **[#981](https://github.com/openagents/openagents/pull/981)** - OpenRouter provider for Effect AI
- **[#1089](https://github.com/openagents/openagents/pull/1089)** - Convex database integration

## Architectural Decisions

### 1. Confect Framework
Using Confect (Effect-TS + Convex) for seamless database integration with:
- Effect Schema validation
- Option types replacing null checks
- Compile-time type safety

### 2. Service Architecture
All Tauri commands wrapped in Effect services:
```typescript
const TauriCommandService = Context.GenericTag<TauriCommandService>("TauriCommandService")
```

### 3. Error Handling
Tagged errors for precise error discrimination:
- `StorageError`, `AuthError`, `APMError`
- `StreamingError`, `ConnectionError`, `MessageParsingError`
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff

### 4. State Management
STM (Software Transactional Memory) for atomic updates:
- Mobile-desktop sync coordination
- Offline-capable state management
- Conflict-free concurrent updates

## Quick Reference

### Common Patterns

**Service Definition**:
```typescript
export class MyService extends Effect.Service<MyService>()('MyService', {
  sync: () => ({ /* methods */ }),
  dependencies: [/* other services */]
}) {}
```

**Error Handling**:
```typescript
Effect.catchTags({
  StorageError: (e) => Effect.fail(new CustomError(e)),
  NetworkError: (e) => Effect.retry(retrySchedule)
})
```

**React Integration**:
```typescript
const useEffectService = () => {
  const runtime = useContext(EffectRuntimeContext)
  // ... hook implementation
}
```

**Streaming**:
```typescript
Stream.fromQueue(queue).pipe(
  Stream.tap(processMessage),
  Stream.runDrain
)
```

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Before Effect | With Effect |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Message Latency | 25ms (polling) | <1ms (streaming) |
| Bundle Size | - | +25KB compressed |
| Code Reduction | - | ~75% in some services |
| CPU Usage (idle) | 5% | <0.1% |

## Next Steps

1. Complete Phase 4 testing coverage
2. Implement agent orchestration patterns
3. Add Effect-based voice recording service
4. Enhance WebSocket handling with Effect streams
