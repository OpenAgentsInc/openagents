Okay, Coding Agent, we've updated our `@effect/ai` packages and have a fresh batch of TypeScript errors. Your analysis in `docs/effect/ai/05-breaking-changes.md` is a good starting point. Here's some additional conceptual guidance to help you refactor the codebase effectively.

**Guiding Principles for Refactoring:**

1.  **Embrace `@effect/ai`'s Abstractions:**

    - **Goal:** Make our code more idiomatic with the new `@effect/ai` version.
    - **Action:** Prioritize using interfaces, types (like `AiResponse`, `AiTextChunk`, `AiError`, `AiTool`), and service patterns (like `AiLanguageModel.Service`) directly from `@effect/ai` whenever possible.
    - **Decision-Making:** If our custom types (e.g., in `src/services/ai/core/`) heavily overlap with new `@effect/ai` types, consider replacing ours or making them simple aliases/extensions. For instance, our `AgentLanguageModel` should align its method signatures (parameters, return types for `streamText`, `generateText`, `generateStructured`) with `AiLanguageModel.Service` from the library.

2.  **Standardize File Naming and Imports:**

    - **Goal:** Eliminate casing conflicts and ensure consistent module resolution.
    - **Action:** Resolve all file casing issues (e.g., `AIError.ts` vs. `AiError.ts`). Choose one canonical casing for each file (PascalCase for modules exporting classes/types like `AiError.ts` is common) and update all import statements across the project to match.
    - **Decision-Making:** Use a tool or script to find all instances if manual replacement is too tedious. Ensure your IDE and Git are configured to respect case sensitivity if possible to prevent future issues.

3.  **Reconcile Custom Types with Library Types:**

    - **Goal:** Ensure seamless interoperation between our custom types and those from `@effect/ai`.
    - **Action:** For errors like "`Property 'X' is missing in type 'A' but required in type 'B'`" (especially for `AiResponse`), this often means our local definition of `AiResponse` (e.g., in `src/services/ai/core/AiResponse.ts`) is out of sync with what `@effect/ai`'s `AiLanguageModel` methods now return or expect.
    - **Decision-Making:**
      - If `@effect/ai`'s `AiResponse` (or equivalent) now has additional mandatory fields (like `finishReason`, `[TypeId]`), update our local `AiResponse` to include them or adapt our code to use the library's type directly.
      - If our code is passing a locally-defined `AiResponse` where a library-defined one is expected, ensure our type is a compatible subtype or perform a proper mapping.

4.  **Update Method Signatures and Parameter Structures:**

    - **Goal:** Call `@effect/ai` and our adapted services with the correct parameters.
    - **Action:** Many errors relate to properties not existing on option types (e.g., `Property 'model' does not exist on type 'AiLanguageModelOptions'`). This means the structure of parameters for methods like `generateText` or `streamText` has changed.
    - **Decision-Making:** Consult `docs/effect/ai/05-breaking-changes.md` and the `@effect/ai` documentation. Pay attention to how prompts (`string` vs. `{ messages: [...] }`), model identifiers, and other common options are now passed. Update our `AgentLanguageModel` interface and all its implementations accordingly.

5.  **Refine Custom Error Handling:**

    - **Goal:** Ensure our custom AI errors are robust and correctly used.
    - **Action:**
      - Address the "Duplicate identifier `AIConfigurationError`" in `AIError.ts` by ensuring class names are unique.
      - Fix `TS2540: Cannot assign to 'name' because it is a read-only property.` by ensuring custom error constructors correctly call `super()` and don't try to assign to `this.name` directly if it's read-only from `Data.TaggedError`.
      - Correct `import type` usage: only use it for types that are solely used as type annotations. If a type is used as a value (e.g., in `instanceof` checks or as a base class), use a regular import.
      - When creating instances of our custom errors (e.g., `AIProviderError`), ensure the constructor arguments match the class definition (e.g., `isRetryable` property).
    - **Decision-Making:** Adopt the standard `Data.TaggedError("TagName")<{...props}>` pattern for all custom errors. This provides good type safety and runtime identification.

6.  **Resolve Module Dependencies:**

    - **Goal:** Fix all `TS2307: Cannot find module 'X'` errors.
    - **Action:** These indicate issues with local imports (e.g., `./OllamaClient`, `./ChatMessage`).
    - **Decision-Making:**
      - Verify the file paths are correct.
      - Ensure the target modules correctly export the needed members.
      - Check `index.ts` barrel files in the respective directories (`src/services/ai/ollama/index.ts`, `src/services/chat/index.ts`) to ensure they are re-exporting all necessary symbols.

7.  **Correct Effect `Layer` and `Context` Usage in Tests:**

    - **Goal:** Ensure Effect-based tests are structured correctly.
    - **Action:** Errors like "`Type 'ServiceX' is not assignable to type 'never'`" in the `R` (Requirements) channel of an `Effect` or `Layer` mean that a dependency is not being provided.
    - **Decision-Making:**
      - When testing a service (e.g., `NIP90AgentLanguageModelLive`), its `Layer` should be _provided_ with mock/test implementations of its dependencies (e.g., `NIP90Service`, `NostrService`).
      - The composition should look like: `SUTLayer.pipe(Layer.provide(MockDependencyLayer))`.
      - When running test effects that depend on a service, use `myTestEffect.pipe(Effect.provideLayer(testLayerForSUT))`. Avoid `Effect.provide(someLayer)` as `provide` expects a `Context`, not a `Layer`.

8.  **Adapt to Library API Changes:**
    - **Goal:** Use the latest APIs from `effect` and `@effect/ai`.
    - **Action:**
      - `Effect.layer` is outdated; use `Layer.effect(Tag, effect)` or `Layer.succeed(Tag, value)`.
      - `StreamChunk` from `@effect/ai-openai/OpenAiClient` is likely internal now. Use the public `AiTextChunk` or similar types exposed by `@effect/ai` or our core abstractions when consuming streams.
      - For the Zustand `PersistStorage` error, ensure you're using `createJSONStorage` to adapt `localStorage` as shown in `src/stores/pane.ts`.
    - **Decision-Making:** When encountering an unknown property or missing export from a library, check the library's latest documentation or its `d.ts` files (as you did with `node_modules/@effect/ai-openai/dist/dts/Generated.d.ts`) to find the new way of achieving the same goal.

By applying these principles, the agent should be able to systematically address the TypeScript errors and align the codebase with the new `@effect/ai` version. Focus on understanding the _intent_ of the old code and translating that intent to the new library patterns.
