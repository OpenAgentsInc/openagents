# Verse Scene Graph vs. react-three-fiber — Construction Audit

Date: 2026-06-21
Scope: how the Autopilot desktop "Verse" 3D world builds its Three.js scene
graph today (via `@openagentsinc/three-effect` + Foldkit), how
react-three-fiber (r3f) solves the same problem, what we should learn from r3f,
what to add to `three-effect`, and how Effect best practices apply.

This is an architecture/direction audit, not an implementation plan. It pairs
with `2026-06-21-spacetimedb-verse-multiplayer-audit.md` (data/transport) and
`2026-06-21-autopilot-auto-forum-loop-and-verse-reflection-audit.md`.

## TL;DR

- Our Verse renderer is a **two-layer imperative pipeline**: pure data mappers
  in `apps/autopilot-desktop/src/shared/*` produce one big
  `TrainingRunVisualizationOptions` record, and `three-effect`'s
  `mountTrainingRunVisualization` imperatively builds the entire `THREE.Scene`
  with manual `.add()` calls and a raw `requestAnimationFrame` loop.
- **The seam has no reconciler.** The Foldkit custom element does a
  `JSON.stringify` equality check on the whole options object and, on *any*
  change, tears down the entire WebGL scene and rebuilds it from scratch. There
  is no diffing, keying, or pooling at the app↔library boundary. (One exception:
  a single bespoke keyed-diff for remote avatars inside the trainingRun scene,
  which the desktop app cannot currently reach through the pinned package.)
- r3f solves exactly this problem with a **catalogue + custom reconciler +
  prop-diffing + attach + on-demand frameloop + automatic disposal**. None of
  those concepts is React-specific; they are the portable ideas.
- `three-effect` uses Effect's *types* (`Data.TaggedError`,
  `Effect.Effect` signatures) but almost none of Effect's *runtime* — **no
  `Scope`, no `acquireRelease`, no `Layer`/service, no `Ref`/`SubscriptionRef`,
  no `Stream`, no `Effect.gen`**. That is the single biggest lever: the
  resource-ownership and reactive-state model r3f hand-rolls is exactly what
  Effect gives us for free.

## 1. How the Verse scene graph is constructed today

### 1.1 Two layers, one record

The Verse world is built on a strict split:

1. **App layer** — `apps/autopilot-desktop/src/shared/*` and `src/ui/view.ts`.
   Pure, Three.js-free data projection. Each "scene" file is a pure function
   that appends descriptors onto a single plain record,
   `TrainingRunVisualizationOptions` (arrays of node / entity / beam / burst /
   world-item / remote-avatar descriptors defined in
   `src/types/three-effect-core.d.ts`). No Three.js, no `.add()`, no render
   loop, almost no Effect. These are unit-testable.

2. **Library layer** — `@openagentsinc/three-effect`. All imperative Three.js.
   `mountTrainingRunVisualization` receives the record and builds the real
   `THREE.Scene`, runs the RAF loop, and disposes resources.

The canonical composition is `verseSceneVisualization` in
`src/ui/view.ts:5849`, an append-only fold of layer functions:

```ts
const base       = pylonNetworkVisualizationOptions(liveScene ?? CHAT_SCENE)
const withTraining = withVerseTrainingLayer(base, {...})
const withBulletin = withVerseBulletinBoardLayer(withTraining, ...)
const withBase     = withPylonBaseLayer(withBulletin, pylonBase)
const withWorld    = withChatWorldMultiplayerLayer(withBase, multiplayer, {...})
// ...then pose, camera, payment layers
```

Each `with*Layer` returns `{ ...base, nodes: [...(base.nodes ?? []), node] }`
(e.g. `verse-bulletin-board.ts:116`, `pylon-base-scene.ts:328`,
`chat-world-visualization.ts:589`). This part is actually clean — it is a
declarative, data-driven description of *what the scene should contain*.

### 1.2 The imperative side

`mountTrainingRunVisualization` (three-effect `packages/core/src/trainingRun.ts`)
does the real construction inside one big `Effect.try` closure: `new
THREE.Scene()`, lights `.add()`ed individually, a `PerspectiveCamera`, a `root`
`Group`, floor grid + street district, and per-descriptor meshes built with
inline `new THREE.XGeometry(...)` / `new THREE.YMaterial(...)`. The render loop
is the classic recursive `requestAnimationFrame` (`trainingRun.ts:~3288`); the
per-frame closure runs controller updates via `Effect.runSync(...)` 60×/s, then
`renderer.render(scene, camera)`.

So: **declarative data on top, classic imperative `.add()` underneath, with a
custom element as the seam.**

### 1.3 The reconciliation seam — full teardown + rebuild

This is the central finding. The Foldkit element
(`packages/foldkit/src/index.ts`):

```ts
set visualization(value: unknown) {
  const signature = stableOptionsSignature(value) // JSON.stringify
  if (signature === this.#visualizationSignature) return
  this.#visualizationSignature = signature
  if (this.isConnected && this.#mount !== null) this.#remount()
}
#remount() {
  this.#unmount()                                  // dispose entire scene
  Effect.runSync(mountTrainingRunVisualization(...)) // rebuild from scratch
}
```

Every time *any* field of the options changes (a pylon comes online, an agent
moves, a payment beam appears, a node flips status), the entire WebGL context,
scene graph, geometries, materials, and RAF loop are destroyed and recreated.
There is:

- **No diffing** of node/entity/beam/avatar arrays.
- **No object pooling/keying** across the app↔library boundary.
- Only a `JSON.stringify` change-detector, which is order- and float-sensitive
  — so the pure mappers must defensively `.toFixed(3)` positions and use stable
  ring layouts purely to avoid spurious remounts. That defensive rounding is a
  smell that points directly at the wrong reconciliation primitive.

For a live agent MMORPG with moving avatars and flying payment particles this
is a **remount-per-tick risk**: repeated `WebGLRenderer` create/dispose (browsers
cap live contexts ~16), GC pressure from reallocating every geometry/material,
lost camera/controller momentum, and visual hitches.

There is exactly one in-place update path in the whole stack:
`updateRemoteAvatars` (`trainingRun.ts:~3359`), a single-purpose
`Map<string, RemoteAvatarRuntime>` diff keyed by `id` with create / update
(interpolate in place) / remove logic. It is the only place that hints at what a
real reconciler would look like — and the desktop app cannot currently use it,
because the app's local `three-effect-foldkit.d.ts` advertises a richer handle
(`updateRemoteAvatars`, presence callbacks) than the *installed* package
forwards. That type/runtime skew should be reconciled regardless of the larger
direction.

### 1.4 The counter-example we already have

`src/ui/hud-status-scene.ts` is a hand-rolled imperative Three.js mini-renderer
(its own `WebGLRenderer`, `Scene`, RAF loop, explicit `disposables[]`). Crucially
it updates **in place** via `setProjection` — `meter.setValue`,
`label.setText`, `material.color.set` — never tearing down. This is the pattern
the world scene *should* adopt, and it proves the team already knows how; it is
just not generalized.

### 1.5 Resource lifecycle today

- **Creation**: inline `new` per object; no shared geometry/material cache, so
  each (re)mount reallocates everything.
- **Disposal**: three-effect has a correct recursive `disposeObject` and a
  thorough `dispose` handle (cancel RAF, disconnect observers, remove listeners,
  dispose geometries/materials/textures, `renderer.dispose()`). It is correct
  but **entirely manual** — a leak is one forgotten `dispose` away, and the
  `Effect.try` mount has a partial-construction leak window (a global `keydown`
  listener is added before later code that can throw; the `catch` path does not
  run partial cleanup).

### 1.6 How Effect actually shows up

Minimally, and only at the boundary:
- App scene files: no Effect.
- `mountTrainingRunVisualization`: returns `Effect.Effect<Handle, MountError>`
  but is one synchronous `Effect.try`; `dispose`/`resize` are `Effect.sync`
  thunks.
- The Foldkit element runs everything with `Effect.runSync` at lifecycle
  callbacks, which also swallows the typed mount errors the code carefully
  builds.
- **No `Scope`, no `acquireRelease`, no `Layer`/service, no `Ref`/
  `SubscriptionRef`, no `Stream`, no `Effect.gen`.** Per-frame mutation uses
  plain closure-captured `let` bindings. Effect here is a typed try/catch
  wrapper, not a structured-concurrency/resource model.

### 1.7 Repeated boilerplate worth extracting

Independent of the reconciler question, these are duplicated across scene files
and want a shared `scene-helpers.ts`:
- `with*Layer(base, x) => ({ ...base, field: [...(base.field ?? []), item] })`
- `uniqueStrings` / `uniqueRefs` dedupe helpers (≥4 copies)
- deterministic ring-layout (`ringPosition` vs `endpointRingPosition`)
- status → renderer-status mappers (`baseNodeStatus`, `statusFromRun`,
  `statusFromRunState`, `toneToStatus`)
- `vectorFromXYZ` / `finite` numeric guards and `.toFixed(3)` rounding
- the evidence record `{motionId, motionKind, sourceRefs, ...}` rebuilt by hand

## 2. How react-three-fiber constructs its scene graph

r3f is a **custom React reconciler** (`react-reconciler` host config) whose
"host instances" are THREE objects rather than DOM nodes. The pieces, all in
`packages/repos/react-three-fiber/packages/fiber/src/core`:

1. **Catalogue + `extend`** (`reconciler.tsx`). A plain object mapping JSX tag
   names → THREE constructors. `extend(THREE)` registers the whole namespace at
   `Canvas` mount, which is why `<mesh>`, `<boxGeometry>`,
   `<meshStandardMaterial>` "just work": the tag is PascalCased and looked up.
   Open-ended — third-party classes register the same way.

2. **The parallel `Instance` descriptor with a `__r3f` back-pointer**
   (`prepare`, `utils.tsx`). Every THREE object carries a lightweight metadata
   node holding `parent / children / props / handlers / attach / previousAttach`.
   r3f maintains its *own* child list independent of THREE's `.children`, which
   is what enables ordered insertion, disposal policy, event registration, and
   reconstruction.

3. **Lazy, Suspense-safe construction.** `createInstance` does not call `new`;
   construction is deferred to `handleContainerEffects` once the subtree is
   actually mounted under the scene, so speculative React work never leaks GPU
   objects. `new target(...args)` is driven by an `args` prop.

4. **`applyProps` / `diffProps`** (`utils.tsx`). Props are applied polymorphically
   by target shape: `THREE.Color.set(...)` for colors, `copy()` for matching math
   types (mutate in place, no realloc), `fromArray()` for `position={[x,y,z]}`,
   `setScalar()` for `scale={2}`, else plain assignment. `diffProps` computes a
   minimal change set with a tunable equality, and — critically — **resets
   removed props to constructor defaults** via a cached blank prototype (THREE has
   no "unset").

5. **`attach`** (`utils.tsx`). The single insight that a child is either *added*
   to the parent's display list (`parent.add(child)`) or *assigned* to a parent
   property slot (`mesh.geometry = box`). Auto-attach infers `geometry`/`material`;
   string attach supports dash-piercing (`material-color`) and array indices;
   functional attach returns a teardown. `detach` restores the previous value.

6. **On-demand frameloop** (`loop.ts`). One global RAF across all roots. Modes
   `always` / `demand` / `never`. A frame counter (`internal.frames`) gates
   demand rendering; `invalidate()` bumps the counter and restarts the loop if it
   had stopped. Every store mutation auto-invalidates, so mutations re-render
   exactly once and then the loop goes idle — power-efficient retained-mode
   rendering. `useFrame` subscriptions are priority-ordered; a positive-priority
   subscriber takes over the render call (custom pipelines / postprocessing).

7. **Automatic, policy-aware disposal** (`reconciler.tsx`). `removeChild`
   recurses depth-first, detaches, removes from THREE, deletes `__r3f`, and
   disposes — honoring a `dispose={null}` opt-out, never disposing primitives or
   `Scene`, and scheduling the actual GPU free at idle priority to avoid frame
   stalls. A separate deep sweep runs on full unmount.

8. **Reconstruction batching.** When immutable constructor `args` change you must
   rebuild; r3f batches reconstructions and flushes at the sibling tail,
   transferring interactivity/refs and disposing the old object.

9. **Store-as-context + selector subscriptions** (`store.ts`, Zustand). Root
   state (`gl / scene / camera / raycaster / size / viewport / frameloop /
   internal`) lives in one store whose *reference* is stable on React context;
   consumers subscribe to slices, so external mutations drive both THREE config
   and on-demand re-renders without re-rendering the whole tree. The store
   subscribes to itself to resize/recompute-viewport/invalidate.

10. **Flat interaction registry + synthetic bubbling** (`events.ts`). r3f does
    not raycast the whole scene; it keeps a flat array of only handler-bearing
    objects, raycasts those, sorts by layer-priority then distance, dedupes, and
    synthesizes DOM-like bubbling by walking parents. `stopPropagation` is a
    flag; pointer-capture is an out-of-band map.

## 3. Side-by-side

| Concern | Verse (today) | react-three-fiber |
|---|---|---|
| Scene description | Declarative data record (good) | Declarative JSX tree |
| Element → THREE class | Hard-coded in one giant mount fn | Catalogue + `extend` |
| Construction | Eager, inline `new` in one closure | Lazy, Suspense-safe, `args`-driven |
| State → scene update | **Full teardown + rebuild on any change** | Keyed reconciliation + minimal prop diff |
| Prop application | Rebuild the object | `applyProps` mutate-in-place by shape |
| Geometry/material parenting | Manual `.add()` / assignment | Unified `attach` (+ dash-pierce, indices) |
| Frameloop | Always-on raw RAF | `always`/`demand`/`never` + `invalidate` |
| Per-frame hooks | One closure; `Effect.runSync` 60×/s | Priority-ordered `useFrame`, render takeover |
| Disposal | Manual, all-or-nothing on remount | Per-node, recursive, idle-scheduled, opt-out |
| Resource ownership | Manual dispose handle (leak-prone) | Reconciler-owned lifecycle |
| Root state | Plain Foldkit model + closure `let`s | Zustand store + selector subscriptions |
| Interaction | (full hit-target registry rebuilt per mount) | Flat handler registry + synthetic bubbling |
| Change detection | `JSON.stringify` signature | Structural per-prop diff with tunable equality |

The gap is not "r3f is declarative and we are imperative" — our *input* is
already declarative data. The gap is that **we have no retained-mode
reconciler between the declarative data and the imperative scene**, so we
collapse every update to a teardown. r3f's entire value is that middle layer.

## 4. What we should learn / port (concepts, not React)

These are renderer-agnostic and translate directly into a non-React,
Effect-based `three-effect`:

1. **A node/element model.** A serializable description of the desired Object3D
   tree: `{ type, key, props, children }`. We already produce something close
   (the descriptor arrays); formalize it into a generic node tree with stable
   `key`/`id` per node so it can be diffed instead of stringified.

2. **A catalogue.** A typed registry mapping node `type` → THREE constructor
   (+ `args`). Mirrors `extend`; lets the trainingRun-specific builders become
   data instead of bespoke code, and lets new node kinds register without editing
   the mount function.

3. **A general reconciler.** Diff previous vs. next node trees keyed by
   `id`: create / update / remove, plus a prop-differ that decides
   **set-in-place vs. dispose-and-recreate** (args/geometry change → recreate;
   color/position change → mutate). The existing `updateRemoteAvatars` map-diff
   is the seed — generalize it from "avatars" to "any keyed children."

4. **`applyProps` by target shape.** Port the small set of setter strategies
   (Color.set, copy for matching math types, fromArray, setScalar, assign) so
   `position`, `color`, `scale` mutate existing objects with no reallocation, and
   port the **default-reset-on-removal** trick (cached blank prototype).

5. **`attach`.** Unify "add to display list" vs. "assign to property slot" with
   dash-piercing, array indices, and functional attach/detach. In Effect this is
   a natural `acquireRelease` (acquire = assign, release = restore).

6. **On-demand frameloop.** Replace the always-on RAF + `disposed` boolean with
   a dirty-signal-driven loop: render only when state changes, then idle. This
   matters for a desktop app's battery/GPU.

7. **Priority-ordered frame subscriptions.** A registry of per-tick callbacks
   ordered by priority, with the option to cede the render call — replaces the
   single hard-coded render closure and makes controllers/animators composable.

8. **Per-node, policy-aware, idle-scheduled disposal.** Recursive, with a
   "don't dispose this" opt-out, never disposing Scenes, freeing at idle.

9. **Shared geometry/material cache.** Once updates stop being full rebuilds,
   cache and reuse primitives keyed by their args to cut allocation/GC.

10. **Flat interaction registry.** Keep hit targets in a registry maintained by
    the reconciler rather than rebuilt wholesale each mount; raycast only
    handler-bearing objects and synthesize bubbling.

What we should **not** do: adopt React, `react-reconciler`, or JSX. The desktop
app is Foldkit/Effect; a React reconciler would be a foreign runtime. We want
r3f's *concepts* implemented on Effect primitives.

## 5. How Effect best practices help

This is the highest-leverage observation: **the machinery r3f hand-rolls in
Zustand + a custom reconciler + manual disposal maps almost one-to-one onto
Effect primitives we are currently not using.** (Per `effect-solutions
services-and-layers` and the repo's Effect 4.x conventions.)

- **`Scope` / `acquireRelease` instead of manual dispose handles.** Each scene
  resource (renderer, geometry, material, texture, RAF loop, event listeners,
  `ResizeObserver`) becomes an `Effect.acquireRelease(create, release)`. Tie each
  reconciled node's GPU resources to a child scope; when the node is removed,
  close its scope and finalizers run automatically. This makes leaks
  *structurally impossible* and closes the partial-construction leak window in
  the current `Effect.try` mount. This is r3f's "automatic disposal," but
  enforced by the type system instead of by reconciler bookkeeping.

- **`Context.Service` + `Layer` for the root state.** Model r3f's store as a
  `SceneContext` service: `renderer`, `camera`, `clock`, `raycaster`, `size`,
  `frameloop`, plus an asset cache. Provide it as a `Layer.scoped` so the
  renderer/cache acquire and release with the scene. This replaces positional
  raw-THREE arguments threaded through builders, and makes scenes testable by
  swapping a headless renderer layer (the team already wants a frame-clock
  abstraction for tests; this is the home for it).

- **`SubscriptionRef` / `Stream` for state → scene.** Hold the declarative node
  tree (or app model) in a `SubscriptionRef`. The reconciler consumes
  `ref.changes` as a `Stream`, diffs old vs. new, and applies the minimal
  mutation. This replaces the `JSON.stringify` signature + full remount with
  r3f's "mutation auto-invalidates and re-renders exactly the delta." The
  multiplayer/SpacetimeDB subscription path (see
  `2026-06-21-spacetimedb-verse-multiplayer-audit.md`) feeds this `Ref`
  naturally — moving avatars become in-place updates, not remounts.

- **A `Stream`/`Schedule`-driven frame clock instead of raw RAF.** Drive frames
  from an Effect fiber so the loop is interruptible by `Scope` (no `disposed`
  boolean), testable (step the clock without real RAF), and gated by a dirty
  signal for on-demand rendering. Per-frame controller updates stop being
  `Effect.runSync` 60×/s inside a JS closure and become part of the fiber.

- **`Effect.gen` + `Effect.fn` for the mount/reconcile path** instead of one
  giant `Effect.try` closure, so construction composes, errors stay typed
  through the boundary (don't `Effect.runSync`-swallow them — surface mount
  failure as a visible degraded state), and call-site tracing works.

- **Keep `Data.TaggedError` / typed errors** — that part is already good; just
  stop discarding them at the Foldkit boundary.

Net: r3f proves the *concepts* (catalogue, instance tree, attach, prop-diff,
on-demand loop, automatic disposal, reactive store). Effect gives us a *better
substrate* for half of them — resource ownership (`Scope`), reactive state
(`SubscriptionRef`/`Stream`), DI/testability (`Layer`/service), and an
interruptible frame loop (fibers) — than r3f's React+Zustand stack.

## 6. Recommendations (priority order)

Direction only; sequencing belongs in an implementation plan.

1. **Fix the type/runtime skew now (cheap, unblocks everything).** Repin or bump
   `three-effect` so the installed package's `TrainingRunVisualizationHandle`
   matches `src/types/three-effect-foldkit.d.ts` (the `updateRemoteAvatars` /
   presence-callback gap). Today the desktop app passes callbacks and expects
   incremental methods that the pinned package silently drops.

2. **Route live updates through the incremental path, not remount.** Once #1
   lands, push moving avatars / beams / status flips through in-place handle
   methods (generalize `updateRemoteAvatars`) so the common per-tick case stops
   triggering `#remount()`. This alone removes the worst WebGL-context churn.

3. **Add a `Scope`-based resource model in `three-effect`.** Convert mount to
   `Effect.gen` + `acquireRelease` for renderer/listeners/observer/RAF and the
   per-node resources. Structural leak safety + closes the partial-mount window.

4. **Introduce a node tree + catalogue + general reconciler in `three-effect`.**
   Promote the descriptor records to a keyed node tree; diff and mutate instead
   of rebuild; port `applyProps`/`attach`/default-reset. Drive it from a
   `SubscriptionRef` fed by the app model.

5. **Replace the raw RAF with a fiber/`Stream` frame clock + on-demand
   rendering** and a priority-ordered frame-subscription registry.

6. **Extract the duplicated pure helpers** (`scene-helpers.ts`: dedupe, ring
   layout, status mapping, evidence record, vector guards) — independent of all
   the above and worth doing immediately.

All of this work belongs in `three-effect` (the workspace's owned home for
spatial primitives, per `docs/game/README.md` "Implementation Homes"), consumed
unchanged by `apps/autopilot-desktop` and `apps/openagents.com`. Do not build an
app-local reconciler in the desktop app.

## 2026-06-21 addendum — retained Verse flicker follow-up

Issue
[`#5911`](https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/openagents/issues/5911) applied the
first recommendation from this audit by aligning the OpenAgents local
`TrainingRunVisualizationHandle` declaration with the installed `three-effect`
runtime. The shim no longer advertises stale `renderNow` / `webglAvailable`
fields and now exposes the retained runtime capabilities actually returned by
`mountTrainingRunVisualization`: `captureLocalPose`, `updateRemoteAvatars`, and
`selectNextTarget`.

This matters to the current Verse flicker work because stale host contracts make
it too easy to keep treating the scene as a disposable render target. The app now
type-checks against the same retained handle that the runtime provides, so
future movement, proximity, and multiplayer fixes have to go through explicit
incremental APIs instead of accidentally depending on full scene replacement.

Issue
[`#5910`](https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/openagents/issues/5910) then applied
the second recommendation to the bulletin-board interaction path. The
`three-effect` Foldkit host no longer writes proximity or presence state back
onto the custom element as `data-*` attributes; it records explicit diagnostics
and dispatches typed events while the WebGL host remains retained. The same
`three-effect` update also keeps the third-person avatar group stable while the
controller GLB loads and fades the loaded model in, so the async model handoff is
not a hard character pop.

The packaged Verse launch smoke now walks into the Tassadar board's interaction
radius and fails unless it observes the board proximity event, sees no blank
movement frames, and records no host remount/swap during the walk. That is the
smallest practical guard for this bug class until the larger
`SubscriptionRef`/reconciler recommendations in this audit are implemented.

Issue
[`#5913`](https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/openagents/issues/5913) applied the
next part of recommendation 2 to live Verse data. The `three-effect` training
scene now exposes a retained `updateVisualization` path, and the Foldkit custom
element compares a retained structural signature instead of treating every
projection change as a full rebuild. The signature deliberately ignores
transient local restore pose and live world-item copy, which were the two
observed flicker triggers: walking fed `thirdPersonController.initialPosition`
back into the visualization, and the public Tassadar summary updated the
bulletin board after first paint.

The practical result is that the Tassadar board can hydrate from "Loading
Tassadar run" to server-provided bulletin lines by recreating only the keyed
board object and hit target. The renderer, camera, controller, and local avatar
stay retained. The packaged Verse launch smoke now injects that live board
update in Chrome and fails if it logs any `verse-host.remount.*` event instead
of `verse-host.visualization.retained`.

Issue
[`#5915`](https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/openagents/issues/5915) applied
recommendation 3's resource-ownership direction in `three-effect`. The package
now exports a small `SceneResourceScope` primitive with LIFO, idempotent
finalizers, child scopes, unregister support, and scoped DOM event listener
ownership. `mountTrainingRunVisualization` uses that root scope for canvas
listeners, keyboard capture, resize observation, controller disposal, and the
root WebGL/scene/canvas finalizer. Dynamically replaced bulletin boards now own
their hit target, keyboard target, scene attachment, and object disposal through
child scopes.

This matters to the current Verse work because retained updates increase the
number of partial replacements inside one mounted scene. Those replacements now
have a local owner that can be disposed independently, while full unmount still
has one root owner. The remaining large visual arrays still need the generic
catalogue/reconciler from recommendation 4 before every scene resource can be
owned by keyed descriptors instead of one-off arrays.

Issue
[`#5914`](https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/openagents/issues/5914) applied the
first slice of recommendation 4 in `three-effect`. The package now exports a
typed `SceneNodeDescriptor` / `SceneNodeCatalogue` /
`createSceneNodeReconciler` primitive that diffs keyed descriptors, retains
same-kind objects, lets a factory reject an update when immutable props require
recreation, preserves descriptor order, and disposes child scopes before parent
scopes. The unit coverage exercises create/update/remove/reorder behavior and
parent-owned child descriptor cleanup.

The live consumer is the Verse bulletin-board path. Tassadar board definitions
now become keyed descriptors handled by that reconciler instead of a bespoke
world-item map. Hydrating from "Loading Tassadar run" to the server-provided
summary can still recreate the board's own mesh/text group when the copy
changes, but that replacement is local to the board node. The renderer, camera,
controller, local avatar, and other keyed scene state remain outside that
change, which directly addresses the character-flicker and board-hydration
failure mode that motivated this audit pass.

Issue
[`#5912`](https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/openagents/issues/5912) applied the
frame-loop part of recommendation 5. `three-effect` now exports a
`createManagedFrameClock` primitive with manual test ticks, demand-mode
`invalidate()` scheduling, priority-ordered subscribers, idempotent disposal,
and cancellation of pending RAF callbacks. The Verse training scene no longer
owns a raw recursive `requestAnimationFrame` / `cancelAnimationFrame` pair; it
subscribes its render/update function to that managed clock and lets the scene
resource scope dispose the clock before WebGL resources are released.

The current Verse consumer still uses `mode: "always"` because the world has
continuous controller, avatar, beam, burst, and interpolation animation. The
important audit alignment is that frame ownership is now a reusable primitive
instead of another closure-local lifecycle, and the same primitive already has
the demand/manual semantics needed by future retained-mode scenes and tests.
