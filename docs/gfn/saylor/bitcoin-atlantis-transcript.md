thank you everybody for showing up so do we want a little sailor chant sailor sa

sa well thank you for coming happy to be in madira um so

I was delighted I got a chance to speak but

I was terrified because I knew that this crowd would already know everything

I'd already said and I'd have to come up with something new to say so

I'm going to put your fears the rest

I'm not going to talk about uh all the things

I I'm not going to recite the breed love sailor series verbatim and we're not going to do the 4our

Lex podcast I actually put together a new presentation today and uh this is

[0:01:01]

my first time that I'm presenting it

I was asked to talk about how bitcoin's can impact corporations and individuals and

I get asked a lot about how do governments perceive

Bitcoin and and uh I've I've spent um you know

I spent a lot of my time uh dealing with corporations talking to

Executives uh talking to institutional investors talking to politicians reading thousands and thousands of pages of government filings

I'm the kind of guy that

I will listen to every minute of congressional testimony just so

I know what each of the 40 congressmen said or thought admittedly

I'll do it on a speed listen but

I will listen because I want to know what they thought and um so what

I prepared today is kind of amalgam of my views on this and

I think um I think this is the perfect audience presented to after

I finish

[0:02:00]

I'm sure I'll get a chance to meet some of you and

I'll look forward to getting your feedback so

I'm going to start with a simple observation

I think we all understand to survive everyone everyone must convert their work into assets that are scarce desirable portable durable and maintainable if you're a living creature you're you're converting your work into organic energy we call it fat

Fat's the most scarce desirable portable durable maintainable asset in the organic

World it might have been demonized but if you can't generate fat you're a type one diabetic life is going to be short and brutal and difficult you really need to be able to store energy now if you're a individual a company a family a government you have the same exact challenge now we all know

Bitcoin is the best asset

[0:03:01]

you agree and there there is no second best

asset and that is why we are here right because we need an asset

Bitcoin is the best there is no second best but why is that the case well let's just start with

Bitcoin is digital and the entire world for the last 5,000 years has lived on analog assets real estate gold silver paper money bonds buildings

Collectibles sports teams livestock cattle and bales of tobacco seashells and glass beads now we have a digital asset in fact this is the digital asset maybe

[0:04:01]

this is the only digital asset now what is that what kind of asset is it well you could think of it as digital capital and

I've you know we've talked about capitalism there are hundreds of trillions of dollars of capital

Bitcoin is digital Capital you could also call it property we have hundreds of trillions of dollars of property in the world

Bitcoin is digital property something you can own we could also call it wealth

Bitcoin is digital wealth analog wealth is when you own hundreds of acres of land somewhere we can also call it digital money money a medium exchange a store of value a unit of account but as you see sometimes when people get wrapped when they when they get focused on money they immediately go to medium exchange and they immediately think about a currency and they immediately get themselves wrapped around the axle in apposition to the peso or the dollar or the area and

[0:05:00]

it becomes a very political discussion when you come back to think of it as property or wealth then it becomes much less political and of course my favorite

Bitcoin is digital energy now fat is organic energy the universe is made up of energy matter is static energy

Einstein showed us that when he gave us the

E equals mc² he said matter is energy energy is matter now

Bitcoin is more than these things

I could I could go on for a while but the point of this is not to talk to you about what

Bitcoin is you already know what

Bitcoin means to you the real point of this discussion is to talk about what

Bitcoin means to the rest of the world bitcoin's going to have many types of participants in the future you know one set of participants one set of people that are going to be plugged into the

Bitcoin Network are clearly individuals there are8 billion individuals on the planet

[0:06:01]

what are individuals going to contribute to the

Bitcoin Network right the individuals bring creativity they bring

Clarity they bring conviction they bring capability they bring the conscience of the to the world and of course they are going to hold they're going to hold

Bitcoin for life right now how many

Lots right right now there are hundreds of millions of individuals that have an interest in

Bitcoin one way shape or the other it's going to be billions it's going to continue to grow and a lot of times a lot of our education is really focused on the individual but

I think that I think that we can't stop with the individual because these individuals form groups families corporations governments they perform nonprofits they form clubs churches there are a lot of ways that individual

[0:07:00]

individual creativity and aspiration manifest itself and of course one of my favorites is families there's a billion families billi about a billion families and why do families matter they're the future of humanity that's why they matter right families bring the compassion they bring the community they bring continuity they bring joy they bring hope and if and a family is is just a much more powerful unit than just an individual families will hold and we start we're starting to think about families now and how they join the network but there's a third organization third type of group an investment company this is a this is an a set of organizations have not been involved in

Bitcoin much uh for the first 15 years of its existence but investment companies can be um they can be mutual funds they can be trust funds they can be exchange traded funds these

TFS they can be hedge funds and they

[0:08:03]

have not trillions but probably hundred trillion dollars worth of assets floating out there and they get to decide how those assets will be disposed of and how they'll be situated and they are actually acting on behalf of families and on behalf of individuals so on one hand you can't write them off when they can decide to to reallocate $10 billion from gold to bitcoin on behalf of 18 million retirees that used to work for the postal service right and when they make that decision they're making that decision that impacts families and impacts individuals but they're also making the decision as a fiduciary and the last 36 days have been an illustration of how important these kind of companies are because every day in the market they're buying hundreds of millions of dollars of

Bitcoin they're trading it and

[0:09:00]

they're building up Billion doll positions this has just started we're 36 days into a massive adoption of just these exchange traded funds but it's going to just keep going and they're going to

Ripple all through the world through all sorts of economies and they will have a profound impact and and in my opinion a profound impact for good uh it used to be if you go back to 2018 in the

Bitcoin community if you said the word you said

Larry thinkink people go they would say oh

Larry Fink doesn't like us and uh in the year 20124

Larry fank goes on television and speaks to leaders in the world and says

Bitcoin is a store of value it it protects the sovereignty of the individual it allows allows you to achieve your hopes it is

Hope Larry think is said Bitcoin is hope now what does that what does that say to me it says we don't have

[0:10:01]

enemies what we have are people that need

Bitcoin that don't yet know why they should be our

friend when someone goes on television and they're ask what do you think about

Bitcoin and they get poked and they're a little bit irritated they got to ask the question they're not an enemy of

Bitcoin they're just not prepared for the question and in fact over time the journalist will do the poking because they know the most important thing in the world today is

Bitcoin and you're going to have a group of people that understand it that will say it's the future and you'll have a a group of people that don't understand it and they will not have embraced it but at the end of the day with time with education we're going to we're going to see more and more people join the network and they're going to participate now now

[0:11:00]

those investment companies aren't the only type of companies they're operating companies and uh and operating by the way how many if you do a quick

Google search 333 million is the count on

Google of companies in the world think about that for a second 333 million there's a lot of companies and and and all of these individuals and all of these families they all act through corporate entities often times you'll see a group of five or six or 10 or 50 or 500 or 5,000 or 50,000 now how important are companies well they provide all the products all the services they develop technology not many people in the room can create their own iPhone you know not many people in the room want to manufacture and and ship all their food or grow their own fruit in the winter these companies are critical to our quality of life we know that from

Austrian economics but if you're wondering like how long

[0:12:01]

have we had specialization of Labor you know one 1 million years ago they dug up

Stone axe factories and it indicates that a million years ago before we had writing before there was recorded history there was a company manufacturing

Stone axes which meant that there was a specialized economy with corporations but there are people growing food there were people hunting there were people fighting there were probably people collecting the taxes to pay for the stone axes for the people fighting it's it's all happened before and uh and today companies like

Apple and Google and Microsoft perform pretty systemically important roles as does the airline that flew you here as does the contractor that built the stadium or built the bridges or the tunnels or the airports you landed on these are important what are they going to bring to bitcoin well they're going to bring

[0:13:00]

new services like cash app as a service they're going to bring new products they're going to bring your your signing devices they're going to bring you full nodes or integrated nodes or or or the like they're going to bring new technology one day

I believe Apple Microsoft Google they will all integrate

Bitcoin and Layer Two protocols like lightning into their phones into their computers into their web services into their cloud services they're going to bring cool applications you know every single

Bitcoin wallet lightning wallet is a cool application it they were all made by a corporation they're going to provide support and and maybe importantly they provide credibility right companies have credibility with the people when when uh when a large corporation offers something to a billion people over the weekend you get 437 million downloads right an individual can't get 437

[0:14:02]

million people to do anything over the weekend when uh when a company has a problem they pick up the phone they call the

White House or they call a senator or they call a congressman or they go to court and they sue companies actually can

Avail themselves of the legal system the political system the executive branch you know sometimes they're in um controversies but companies have credibility and that credibility will will defend the network it will spread the network it will enhance the network it will uh it will actually embrace or enhance and support the lives of every individual and every family we need them right companies are companies are not you know the evil empire creature that's against you companies are just made up of people and the person running the company either understands

Bitcoin or they don't and if they don't then

[0:15:01]

they're just a supporter waiting to be recruited or there'll be someone that understands it you know and and they own it personally and they're waiting for the political environment in their company to change so that they can buy it corporately you know

Tim Cook has has uh admitted to you know owning

Bitcoin right lots of senior level

CEOs own it sometimes they're reacting to their shareholders their board of directors their employees their regulators and privately individually they would pursue one one uh agenda but publicly because they have to uh report or they have to represent the corporate interest and they have to respect the constituencies they serve like the customers that don't understand it they have to wait until their customers understand it or demand it before they can move but ultimately these operating companies are going to be great supporters of the network they

[0:16:01]

already are and they will hodal they're going to build

Bitcoin on their balance sheets in the same way now we get to everybody's favorite

Banks right and you can be your own bank that's the promise of

Bitcoin but you know there are thousands if not tens or hundreds of thousands of banks in the world and there serving they're serving you know who knows how many people you know billions and billions of people and they're custody hundreds of trillions of dollars of assets and they are intertwined essentially in the fabric of the economy and

Bitcoin offers them something too it offers them the same benefits and many of the benefits it offers a family and individual

Corporation what do they do well they they custody extend credit they'll give

[0:17:00]

you a loan they make they deal with compliance rules how many different sets of rules are there in the world there's 10,000 jurisdictions 10,000 different sets of rules and the banks have armies of lawyers and accountants and compliance people to figure out how to give you a mortgage or to figure out how to give you a car loan right it's a lot of work you know you don't really want to borrow money from the

Dude down the street right they call that aone shark and yes you can do it but the interest rate you know is going to run to 70% a year not 7% a year so however bad you think it is with a bank it gets infinitely worse when it's an individual right and uh they don't sue you they break your legs when you don't pay the bill so banks are really important for these things they also have a important role in transfer settlement moving moving assets around millions of times a

[0:18:01]

day or billions of times a day and ultimately you know they used to joke

Banks where all the money are where all the money is banks will holdal banks will also hold

Bitcoin on their balance sheet in time as well nonprofits right how important are nonprofits your church your school right your your soccer team or your clubs right the

Garden Club the Pet Club The

Horse Association the Olympics every possible nonprofit every activist group you you know that almost 6% of the

US economy is nonprofits I mean it's a

Prof it's an incredible amount right and so what what can they contribute well they educate they

Empower they will expand the Bitcoin

Network throughout the world they'll go places that you know maybe you don't want to go and they will go right uh they will drive engagement

[0:19:03]

right that they have missions to engage with the weak the young the old the poor

I mean everybody everywhere over the

Border where you are not they go into dangerous

War zones they're the Red Cross right they provide medical services right and they provide advocacy they're pretty effective at providing advocacy when they're on your side they spread ideas all through the world and when they're against you they can can also be not so good and they're endowed right the greatest endowments of the world the

Harvard the Yale endowments right uh these institutions like

Cambridge or Oxford they've been around for hundreds and hundreds of years that's because they have endowments

Bitcoin is the best the best asset in the endowment right this is a solution to them and this is a need they have and and we will see more and more of them

Embrace this and then finally I

[0:20:02]

I I could subdivide the world into 37 categories but

I'm going to end with governments because often times people think well the government is against

Bitcoin and what I'm here to says the government is made up of people and the government's here to provide essential

Services everywhere on Earth to deal with with defense water sewer education medicine

Insurance social security for the young for the old for the orphans there's a lot of things governments do including keeping traffic working and keeping the ports working and so how do they integr how what can they bring to the

Bitcoin Network education we're actually here in madira at the

IM the only reason I'm here is

I was invited here by the president of

madir and so they have this role they they will integrate they will provide

[0:21:00]

security I think governments will will eventually engage in

Bitcoin mining they will support Bitcoin miners they will defend

Bitcoin miners when you see a world of a hundred different countries all of them mining

Bitcoin then then a tack on one of the of the

Bitcoin miners may result in a response by another country so

I think the governments will also be

Advocates and the governments have balance sheets and the governments will hotle so everybody here they all need

Bitcoin they can all contribute to bitcoin and they all supported so key

Point everybody and when I say everyone

I don't mean every person I mean every entity every the ones you love the ones you hate your enemies your friends the company you dislike the company that you adore the other family the whatever your favorite sports team and the awful soccer team that beat your soccer

[0:22:00]

team sawry awful football team that beat your football team it's not just

Bedford that needs Bitcoin um Everybody benefits from

Bitcoin they might not know it but they do benefit why they benefit because because the story of civilization is about purging toxicity from our systems right humans started

Living longer when we realized we shouldn't drink water with germs in it and then we realize we why do we cook our food to get the toxic germs out of the food right and then at some point we realize that if we could get the toxic pathogens out of our blood we might live longer antibiotics are about getting the toxins out of your blood right sterilization boiling water is about getting the toxins of the water cooking food is about getting the toxins out of

[0:23:01]

the food we've lived with toxic money for 5,000 years the money is simply the economic energy coursing through every government every corporation every group every family every individual when it's when it's moving through your p&l right and it's toxic it's undermining your performance but when you store it in your treasury right right then it's actually just undermining your life expectancy so toxicity is holding us back in 1900 the average life expectancy was 50 by 1950 it was 70 that was the conquest of infectious disease another way to say it was overcoming tox toxic pathogens and we did it with a combination of sterilization modern medicine antibiotics okay everybody wants to live longer even the people you disagree with

[0:24:02]

even the people with missions you don't agree with they all want to achieve more of it and they all want to achieve more of it by not being held back by toxicity so everyone needs it everyone benefits from it but the most important point is everyone benefits

Bitcoin right when the when the bank that you hate starts to custody

Bitcoin well that just means that the

Bitcoin that you self- custody became worth 10 times as much right that these

ETFs that have bought up 1% of the supply of

Bitcoin well they have conveyed 100x as much benefit to the people that don't believe in

ETFs right it's $400 billion dividend to people that don't like

ETFs they're not hurting you what happens is when your enemy joins you get you're improved and the network is improved and the likelihood of

War decreases we we move

[0:25:02]

if we want to eliminate war and conflict and violence we really want all of our enemies to settle their differences in a fair

Equitable fashion and the fair Equitable peaceful way to sell your differences is

Bitcoin so you shouldn't fear those who don't understand who are your enemy who join

Bitcoin you should fear those who are your enemies that don't join

Bitcoin they're the ones that will use bullets to solve the

problem so let's get to the

Happy part how are individuals going to benefit from

Bitcoin well what is what does

Bitcoin bring you right I mean it empowers everyone to live their best possible life right it is bringing you

Freedom economic freedom political Freedom you

[0:26:01]

go where you want you have you have control of your destiny it's not that different that you know for people that fast we've discovered that you don't got to eat for three or four days and when you realize you don't have to eat for five days at a time that's pretty empowering like

I can go through an airport without stopping to eat it's pretty amazing well imagine being able to go where you want to go it opens up opportunity for you it provides you with emotional security mental security physical security

Economic Security it provides camaraderie I mean look at us all here today

I have something in common with every one of you and it's just

awesome I invite you all to think about your relationships and the nature of your relationships before you discovered

Bitcoin and then think about how they changed after after you discovered

Bitcoin right I I just see it as like

[0:27:02]

it's like coming out out of the darkness into the

light and that and that's why

I see Bitcoin as empowerment and

Hope For The Individual but for the family what does it mean to the family it is a foundation to support your family for

Generations right what is the tragedy of the family the tragedy of a family is when you run your family on toxic money and you build your family on defective assets and defective property

I'll give you a classic cliche tragedy our family came to this country my great-grandfather bought this

Farm my grandfather farmed this land my father farmed this land now

I can't pay the taxes on it we got to sell it and all move into like

Apartments why because property is a defective way as

[0:28:03]

it was the best idea 200 years ago

I get it but if you actually own a thousand acres and then someone comes in and creates a state and a mayor gets elected and the mayor decides to spend a lots of money on whatever and they raise your taxes and raise them again and raise them a third time pretty soon the people with the farm can't pay the taxes and then the government decides that you're the bad guy they take all your land and inject you or evict you you know and maybe they don't do it directly maybe first you mortgage the farm and then you can't pay the mortgage and then the bank seizes your property and that's a tragedy and what is the tragedy the tragedy is you built your family on a defective asset you need a an defective money not your fault

I mean look you go back a million years people are dying at age 28 they have no antibiotics we didn't know that sugar was toxic our teeth fell out we didn't know how to how to deal with a pneumonia infection you

[0:29:00]

get cut you die you know someone drinks water it kills them you eat the wrong food you get dentry you get chalera no you know whatever the

H the history of humanity is people dying and suffering because of toxicity and the promise of technology is first we come up with the science to figure out it's toxic right the microscope let us look into the and realize that there were bacteria that were killing us right you need the instrument then you need the understanding then you solve the problem right that that is the story of civilization that that is how humans progress well with families a lot of families struggle and and the economic struggle is a defective economic strategy

Bitcoin gives you that foundation and you can use it to protect your family relocate anywhere change your career here create a legacy

[0:30:00]

accumulate more assets accumulate wealth plan for the future you know if you asked me if before

Bitcoin if you asked me how are you gonna how are you gonna create or or fund your foundation for the next hundred years

I would have said something like

I guess I give all my money to

Wall Street and I hire some good money managers and 70 years from now the grandson of someone that

I hired today might go to college figure out what to do and and day trade or shuffle my money around so

I don't lose it man I mean that's the best idea it's not a good idea right right that's how the

Rockefellers do it right but but you know that what you'll see is that a hundred years after someone actually accumulates some wealth the money's generally gone 99% of the time and what

Bitcoin offers to family is the would actually plan for your great granddaughter and think that maybe

[0:31:02]

there'll be some support for them and uh no one is going to take it from

them why do those OP why do those investment companies need

Bitcoin right they need Bitcoin to attract

Capital you see it happening $600 million flowing into black rock yesterday

Bill 10 billion dollar in a month right if you look at the

ETFs what you'll see is that the

Bitcoin ETFs are crawling up past all the

Commodities they're about to eat the gold

ETFs and then they're going to eat the

S&P 500 index ETFs and when that

happens everybody's going to take note

Vanguard is going to take

[0:32:01]

note right that the world is going to change you can't attract

Capital without Bitcoin and you can't outperform

Bitcoin is going to outperform the

SNP and gold and bonds and and as it outperforms everyone who's indifferent and objective who doesn't know what it is and doesn't care right they're going to just say move more of my money over here because the world's full of people that would just like to not lose their money right and uh and so what we're going to see is investment companies need this to outperform and that's going to result in them generating income and that results in them staying relevant right

I mean how many people are bragging about their you know new gold

ETF right it's not relevant it's not relevant

[0:33:02]

um you want to be a leader right the people that we that we look to are the people that were that that discovered or or created

Google and apple and Microsoft and they create the next airplane and you know they they put starlink in the sky and they give us internet and they give us the next phone right be relevant be a leader these companies want to be leaders you won't find a

CEO that says my aspiration is to be viewed as as a follower and late to the next great thing and they all want to create shareholder value right you can't create shareholder value by shrinking and so that takes us to operating companies it's the same thing but operating companies for the most part in the world are like type 1 diabetics

I I had a 100 competitors over 20 years they all failed there's a 99% mortality rate with

[0:34:00]

these companies right you look at the number you're like well

I don't know 300 million companies that's because they're failing

Millions every single month they're all failing all the time why are they failing they can't store energy they can't harness

Capital right what does Facebook do they give all their

Capital back to the shers and a dividend and and a buyback what does

Apple do they give their Capital back and a dividend and a buyback they take on debt how do companies fail they leverage up they take on debt what happens when you take on debt well instead

I used to say to people well we have 500 million in capital we could go for 40 quarters we go for 10 years and not make any money and we'll still be in business it's like you could go for 10 years and not eat and still be alive that's indestructible on the other hand when you give all the money back and then you borrow a billion dollars well in that case you end up with a debt

Covenant and you have to generate $27 million this quarter and if you generate $26 million

[0:35:02]

this quarter if you miss buy one one 1,000th of your capital structure if you miss by 0.1% you actually trip all the debt covenants and the bank owns you you're technically you're technically in violation of your of your debt they can call the loan you're ins solvent so think about the difference between you starving to death if you miss one meal versus you starving to death when you haven't eaten for the year okay that's the difference between having capital and having no

Capital the status quo in the world today is we tell people you can't keep capital in an operating company because all of the uses all the the liquid capital is dilutive and it doesn't beat the cost of capital

Bitcoin solves the problem you can harness

Capital you can improve your products you can grow your revenues you can can beat inflation for the first time you know this

The Magnificent Seven

[0:36:02]

are good Investments the other 493 companies are not because the other 493 companies cannot beat inflation because beating inflation means raising increasing your cash flow 8% every year forever or more like raising your prices 10% a year forever who can do that a digital

Monopoly a company with no cost with

Monopoly pricing power how many of them are there in the world like there's like one in 10,000 companies that you would know of and one in a thousand public companies okay so these companies the ones that you might be afraid of they're not winning right they're struggling in the same way and

Bitcoin is a Lifeline for them that you could think of them as wage slaves in the same way that you are a wage slave everybody is working having to get 10% more every year just to keep

[0:37:01]

ahead of inflation it's just theirs as in revenue and cash flow and so what does

Bitcoin offer them extended lifespan you see a

CEO and you say well you're going to adopt

Bitcoin he says why should I say well it might keep your company from going bankrupt in 10 years it might it might allow you to continue to do business and serve your customers for the next hundred years how many companies are 100 years old not many

I'll ask you another question how many famous education institutions with endowments are 100 years old most of them right why is it that that universities last 100 years and companies don't no

Capital that's why you think anybody goes in business wanting to die that you think they want to have their company fail in 12 years or 6 years or 25 years no they're stuck in system right they're stuck in a

[0:38:00]

traditional system that makes them do this banks have the same issue they want to attract and retain

Capital they want to decrease risk you know you could say well you know the bank is beholding the

Central Bank well here's another V

Vision what about 100,000 banks that are all tapped into the

Bitcoin Network and they don't have to worry about the

Bitcoin Network shutting them down right when a bank joins

Bitcoin it becomes systemically robust much more anti fragile this is a benefit to

Banks right they' like to find a way to do this this will decrease their risk increase their earnings let them create shareholder value let them

Delight their clients they have a billion customers they have corporations they need to serve them all of these companies all of these nonprofits they all need the bank to support what they do right and in time they will the the nonprofits are also going to benefit they want to raise

Capital

[0:39:01]

but also they have endowments they want their endowments to go up 40% a year not go up 4% a year right there's nobody running a church a charity a benefit a school that'll say we don't want our endowment to appreciate and we don't want an endowment this allows them to harness technology this allows them to extend their reach globally you know

Bitcoin is money that's global and has got a halflife of forever all of these all of these endowments they're using money that has a halflife of 10 years or five years your property might have a half life of 20 years their

Investments are short duration and their

Investments are local right their property is local so

Bitcoin stretches your scope across time and space now tell me what itable

Pursuit doesn't want to do more and last

[0:40:02]

forever they all do right you won't find anyone that that says well we just want to be out of business in three years so bitcoin's the solution to nonprofits and for governments traditionally people have thought you know well the government doesn't like or won't

Embrace Bitcoin but you know they will

Embrace Bitcoin because Bitcoin provides them with the financial power to thrive in the 21st century and there's no there's no government on

Earth that doesn't appreciate the power of money right this will allow them to lower taxes it will allow them to strengthen their currencies defend their sovereignty improve their economies join the global community and

Delight their citizens and and if you talk to any politician there's none of them that will say these aren't agenda items for them and if you say well well could you achieve that with infinite money they would say well

I don't know

[0:41:01]

if I could achieve it but it would make it a lot easier right and if you said well how about if

I just took all your money away from you in five years would that make it easier or harder and the answer is it would make it somewhere between hard and impossible so now

I get to the important part of my talk this is where you come in

ask not what Bitcoin can do for you ask what you can do for

Bitcoin Bitcoin needs you that's the reason if you're wondering why you're here you're here because

Bitcoin needs you and and my deepest hope is when you leave you'll leave believe empowered inspired and

[0:42:00]

enabled to go do good for

Bitcoin wherever you go back to after you leave madira

I can't stress this enough everyone you encounter is an opportunity to improve the

World by gaining their support for

Bitcoin your customers your employees your boss your investors your clients the mayor the the co

Co on the team the parents at the at the

PTA meeting the teachers of your kids the doctor at the hospital you're a dentist everybody you run into is an opportunity and what we can do collectively that'll make the biggest difference is spread to people right the knowledge of

Bitcoin is like if you knew that drinking dirty water would kill you you would tell people you love to stop drinking it if you knew antibiotics

[0:43:00]

could save their life you would tell them about your experience when it comes to this and we we

I've got the orange pill here and we talk about orange pilling but but

I break it down in uh in two different

Cycles right first of all everybody you meet has an intellectual perspective on bitcoin okay and they're going to click through these five gears the first perspective is denier

Bitcoin is a scam it's tulit bulbs it doesn't exist it's a ghost a mirage a pyramid scheme and if we convince them that you know

I would show them a picture of all the

Bitcoin miners in the world and say oh you look there's like hundreds and hundreds of data centers burning more gigawatts of electricity than the

US Navy this is not a scam this is the most powerful computer network in the world and we want to get them from denier to skep the skeptic is okay

I get it Bitcoin may

[0:44:00]

be a good thing but it's too good to be true the government's going to ban it you hear that a lot okay it's good

I get it but someone's going to take it away from you the skeptic and what you have to then show is well if the government was going to ban it they wouldn't be bragging about having captured three billion of it and selling it in the open market right nor would they have approve the

ETFs nor will they be fighting over who gets jurisdiction over it right and we need to move people from

Den I are a skeptic and then the next step we take the trader okay well maybe

I guess I might buy some but

I'll probably sell it I don't you know

I'll buy it if it's going up

I'll sell it if I think it's going down

I don't have an opinion but look that's a step up and then hopefully they get to that next level investor

Bitcoin is great technology just like

Google just like apple just like

Microsoft just like water electricity cars and planes are great technology it's technology it's the future

I should

[0:45:02]

invest in it you made a lot of money on the

Magnificent 7 how do you not own

Bitcoin do you not believe in the

Magnificent 7 you think semiconductors won't make a difference you don't believe in artificial intelligence they have the same

Cycles by the way once we get them to invest are the last step until actually is

Bitcoin is an instrument of economic empowerment and if

Jack dorsy is here I give him a shout out

Jack dorsy put that in my

head by the way don't get don't get dejected that someone may actually be a denier you know who was a denier me and you know what

I became next a skeptic and at some point

I looked and I said you know the world's kind of messed

[0:46:02]

up and interest rates are zero and my dollars are generating zero

I'm going to buy Bitcoin and

I became a Trader and then after

I bought the Bitcoin I started reading a lot more and listening a lot more podcasts and thought about it and

I realized no I should be an investor you know and

I I would say when I got in the when you started hearing about me

I was kind of at the investor stage but it was everybody in this community and every every

Bitcoin podcaster and every writer and every educator that collectively got me over the line to becoming a maximalist where

I said so yeah if you don't think you make a difference you do make a difference right you're never going to see a collection of people like this at a at an apple investor conference or at a

[0:47:01]

Google investor or Microsoft investor or

Nvidia investor conference or gold investor conference this is very special

I like the orange I'll marry the orange um when you're orange ping right you're working people intellectually but there's also spiritual and they all start as observers it's all the people writing about

Bitcoin on Twitter and they observe it but they don't own any and then they become participants and then they start to actually buy and build on it and maybe they own like 1% and then the believer say wait a minute this really is the best asset and maybe 40% of my portfolio is liquid and my rest of my wealth is in my house and so they go and they start to put a bunch of their liquid wealth in the the

Bitcoin because they're Believers and then at some point you get to be

[0:48:01]

hardcore and I'll call you an adherent and then you're like all in it's like the only thing

I want to invest in is

Bitcoin you know I'm not saying you got to sell all your chairs just the ones you don't need but this is a spiritual journey and then and then at the final point you become an advocate and when you're an advocate it's not just you're

Allin you want to go tell other people you want to convince your company your charity your church your government your friends your family you're an advocate so think of this as a as a

Continuum and we're working together to move people from the lower left quadrant you know denier or

Observer and they're going to say well don't talk to me about

Bitcoin they know about it but they don't want to talk about it and you move to the upper right quadrant you know you're a maximalist and you're an advocate and uh you know and and you don't necessarily just stay there we all got to work together to

[0:49:00]

keep ourselves motivated to be in that quadrant because it can be uh quite a drain but

I but I just leave you with this thought right which is

Bitcoin grows stronger with every new participant at any level right it you know you can say whatever you want about me just spell the name right right say the name right

Bitcoin Bitcoin right when when people are talking crap about

Bitcoin we're winning when they're not sure about

Bitcoin we're winning when they're liking it we're winning when they're debating something we're winning right

Bitcoin grows stronger and um I posted this yesterday it's like

Bitcoin represents the digital transformation of capital what is that worth that is worth half of everything in the human race it's half of everything there's other stuff medicine politics educ

I don't dismiss it but the digital

[0:50:00]

transformation of capital and energy and property means that every person every family every corporation every government every movement can live their best life achieve their greatest aspirations right and and when you think about that

Olympic Athlete and you walk in the room you say hey guess what the new science came in we don't have to bleed you this week you know you get to keep your blood while you're working out you know and and we're not going to cut off your oxygen right at that point you think maybe you got a chance to win this thing and so

I want to thank everybody and just end with the observation bit coins for

everyone

[0:51:00]

yeah
