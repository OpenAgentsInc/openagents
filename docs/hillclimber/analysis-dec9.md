Gavin [Baker] explains that the bear case for AI capex spend is on-device inference:

"In three years, on a bigger phone, you'll be able to run a pruned-down version of Gemini 5, Grok 4, or ChatGPT.

And that's free. This is clearly Apple's strategy - we're going to make it privacy-safe and run on the phone.

Other than scaling laws breaking, edge AI is by far the most plausible and scariest bear case."

Hedge fund man makes sense here

But thinks this will take three whole years? Nah

Even the recent "uh-oh maybe bearish capex trade" realizoors are still dramatically overestimating timelines to that shift happening

Because they're thinking in terms of what edge inference & test-time compute ONE device can do for THAT user

Ignoring the economics of AGGREGATED compute (or "swarm" compute as we've been calling it for a long time: https://x.com/OpenAgentsInc/status/1926403708658544794) across millions of devices currently idle

If you have SPARE, UNUSED ("stranded") COMPUTE on your device that I CAN PAY YOU FOR, of course you'll sell it to me for a teensy bit of bitcoin straight to your wallet

Well guess who's been building all of the pieces for this new platform shift across 198 videos for the last two years.

You'll want to stay tuned for episodes 199 and 200 😎
