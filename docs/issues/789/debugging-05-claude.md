 I've implemented all the recommended debugging steps from the analysis:

  1. Removed the Initial Ping:
    - Commented out the await responseStream.write(":\n\n"); line, which was likely causing the client-side parsing issue.
  2. Added Comprehensive Logging:
    - Added logs for entering/exiting the stream callback
    - Added logs for the full tools object structure to verify it's formatted correctly
    - Added logs before and after piping the data stream
  3. Added Try/Catch around streamText:
    - Wrapped the streamText call in a try/catch to capture any immediate exceptions
    - Added better error handling in the catch block
    - Added onFinish callback for additional insights
  4. Simplified by Temporarily Removing Tools:
    - Commented out the tools and toolChoice parameters to test basic streaming without tools
    - This will help determine if the issue is with the tool definitions or more fundamental
  5. Fixed Type Safety:
    - Corrected the types for tool definitions
    - Removed the invalid check for writableEnded property that doesn't exist in Hono's StreamingApi
    - Improved error handling in the stream callback

  These changes address the most likely causes of the client-side parsing error, starting with removing the initial ping (highest
  probability fix) and then progressively investigating other potential issues with more detailed logging.
