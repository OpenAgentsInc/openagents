 The changes are now complete and ready for deployment:

  1. Enhanced extractToolDefinitions()
    - Now dynamically maps all discovered GitHub tools to proper Zod schemas
    - Handles different parameter types (string, number, boolean, arrays, objects)
    - Preserves required vs optional parameters based on the MCP tool schema
    - Includes proper error handling for each tool
  2. Improved Tool Call Handling
    - Asynchronously processes tool calls via the streamResult.toolCalls Promise
    - Added better error handling for individual tool calls
    - Improved logging with result previews
    - Added try/catch blocks to prevent failures in one tool from affecting others
  3. Enhanced streamText Configuration
    - Added temperature setting for better tool usability
    - Improved error logging with full stack traces
    - Better console logging with tool counts and availability
  4. Type-safe Implementation
    - All code passes TypeScript checks with no errors
    - Properly typed parameters and return values
    - Handles the AI SDK's expected types correctly

  The implementation now supports all GitHub MCP tools, not just the single create_issue tool we were using for testing. This should
  provide a much richer experience when using the chat interface with GitHub operations.
