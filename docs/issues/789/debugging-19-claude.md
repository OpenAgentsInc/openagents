‚è∫ The implementation has been successfully updated with these key changes:

  1. Fixed Tool Definitions in tools.ts:
    - Now creates all GitHub MCP tools with Zod schemas
    - Removed the execute property that was causing TypeScript errors
    - Properly maps parameter types from MCP schemas to Zod equivalents
    - Handles required vs. optional parameters appropriately
  2. Fixed Tool Handling in index.ts:
    - Uses an asynchronous monitor for tool calls via streamResult.toolCalls
    - Processes tool calls manually using our MCP client
    - Logs all results for debugging and client-side display
    - Includes proper error handling for individual tool calls
  3. Implementation Notes:
    - The TypeScript compilation now passes with no errors
    - The implementation recognizes the limitations of the current SDK version
    - We've taken a pragmatic approach to monitor tool calls but not try to feed results back
    - This ensures tools can be discovered and executed, even if the full round-trip can't be automated

  The key difference in this implementation is that we're not trying to use the SDK's onToolCall or submitToolResult methods that don't
  appear to be available in the current SDK version. Instead, we're manually monitoring the toolCalls promise and processing tools with
  our MCP client as they come in.

  This should allow the integration to work as a first step, with the client UI needing to handle displaying tool results.
