‚è∫ I've implemented the fixes according to the Vercel AI SDK documentation:

  1. In tools.ts:
    - Created tool definitions using the standard tool() helper
    - Kept tool parameters using Zod schemas for proper typing
    - Removed the execute function to avoid TypeScript errors
    - Preserved complete parameter mapping from MCP to Zod schemas
  2. In index.ts:
    - Added toolCallStreaming: true to enable full tool call streaming
    - Used the official streamResult.toolCalls Promise to wait for tool calls
    - Implemented manual execution for tool calls using the MCP client
    - Properly logged execution results
  3. Key improvements:
    - All code passes TypeScript checks
    - Following the documented SDK pattern for streaming text with tools
    - Proper error handling at each level
    - Detailed logging for debugging

  The approach now aligns with the SDK documentation and should properly handle tool calls from the model while maintaining the correct
  request context in Cloudflare Workers.
