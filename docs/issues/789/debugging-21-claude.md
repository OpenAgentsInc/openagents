‚è∫ Now the implementation correctly executes the tools in the server as per the documentation:

  1. Added execute function to each tool definition in tools.ts:
    - Each tool now has an execute function that processes tool calls
    - The execute function calls the MCP client with the appropriate args
    - Includes proper error handling and logging
  2. Improved auth token handling:
    - Passing auth tokens via headers to the streamText function
    - Accessing these headers in the execute function via the options parameter
  3. Optimized tool monitoring:
    - Updated the monitoring code to recognize that execution happens automatically
    - Added more detailed logging with toolCallId for better tracking
  4. TypeScript compatibility:
    - Used type assertions to work around TypeScript limitations
    - All code now passes TypeScript checks

  This implementation follows the proper approach from the Vercel AI SDK documentation for tool execution, where:
  1. Tools are defined with parameters and an execute function
  2. The SDK automatically executes tools when the model calls them
  3. Execution happens in the request context, avoiding Cloudflare Worker limitations

  This should resolve the issues we were seeing previously.
