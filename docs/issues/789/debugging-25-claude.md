‚è∫ The issue now is with authentication for GitHub operations. Looking at the logs, there's a clear pattern:

  1. The Claude model sees the GitHub tools (26 tools successfully registered)
  2. When trying to use them, it gets an error accessing GitHub content
  3. No tool calls are actually being made (the log shows "0 tool call(s) were made")
  4. There's also an authentication error in the headers: "x-clerk-auth-message: Invalid JWT form"

  The problem is most likely that while we fixed the OpenRouter authentication, the GitHub token isn't being provided by the client. This
   explains why the AI can see the tools but can't successfully use them.

  Two things need to be fixed:

  1. The client needs to send a valid GitHub token in the X-GitHub-Token header
  2. The system prompt should clarify to the model that it needs to request authentication when trying to access GitHub content

  When a user starts a chat, they need to authenticate with GitHub first. The error message from the model ("I apologize, but I'm
  experiencing persistent technical issues trying to access the repository content") suggests it's trying to use GitHub tools but failing
   due to missing authentication.

  Add a prompt to your UI asking users to authenticate with GitHub before using GitHub tools, and make sure the token is passed in the
  appropriate header.

> but it just worked before that, why the difference

‚è∫ You're right, that's puzzling. If it worked before, then suddenly stopped working, there are a few possible explanations:

  1. Session Expiration: If you had a successful GitHub authentication that worked for one request, it might have expired or been
  invalidated
  2. Different Input: The previous successful request might have used a different prompt that didn't trigger GitHub API access, or
  accessed public data that didn't require authentication
  3. Contextual Awareness: The model might be aware of GitHub tools but not aware it needs to ask for authentication information before
  using them
  4. Caching Effects: There might have been cached results that worked for the first request but failed for subsequent ones
  5. Model Behavior Differences: The model might be handling tools differently between requests

  To diagnose this, I would:

  1. Check if your GitHub token is still being sent in the header
  2. Try a simple GitHub tool request that worked before
  3. Compare the logs between the successful and failed requests to see what's different

  The most likely issue is that the GitHub token isn't being properly passed in the header for the second request. The token is required
  for both requests - the difference may be that the first request accessed public data that worked without a token, while the second
  request needed authenticated access.

> i see that the tool call works when its the first message but not ones after that. but why does it even need to use the same
  connection, shouldnt it just start its own when theres a second api call

‚è∫ You've identified a key insight - the issue appears to be related to subsequent messages in the same conversation.

  You're absolutely right that each API call should ideally establish its own connection to GitHub rather than reusing the same
  connection. This is especially important in a serverless environment like Cloudflare Workers where state isn't maintained between
  requests.

  The issue is likely in how the MCP client connection is being managed:

  1. Connection Reuse: The MCP client manager is probably trying to reuse connections between requests instead of establishing fresh
  connections each time
  2. Stateless Environment: In Cloudflare Workers, connections can't be maintained between different requests, causing issues when trying
   to reuse them
  3. Missing Reconnection Logic: The code might be assuming a connection exists when it's actually been closed or invalidated

  Here's what should be happening:
  - Each new request should establish a fresh connection to the MCP server
  - The client should detect when a connection is invalid and reconnect automatically
  - Authentication tokens should be passed with each connection attempt

  To fix this, we should modify the MCP client manager to:
  1. Clear connection cache between requests or force reconnection for each request
  2. Add better detection for stale connections
  3. Ensure authentication tokens are properly passed each time

  This approach would work better with the stateless nature of Cloudflare Workers where maintaining connections between requests isn't
  reliable.

‚è∫ I've made comprehensive changes to fix the connection handling issues in the MCP client:

  1. Forced Fresh Connections for Each Request:
    - Modified the MCP client to create a fresh connection for each request
    - Added unique request IDs to track connections throughout the lifecycle
    - Implemented proper cleanup of stale connections
  2. Enhanced Error Handling and Retries:
    - Added automatic reconnection logic if a connection fails
    - Implemented retry mechanism for tool calls that fail due to connection issues
    - Added timeouts to prevent hanging on network operations
  3. Improved Connection Management:
    - Removed startup connection which becomes stale
    - Each request now establishes its own fresh connection
    - Added disconnection of existing connections before creating new ones
  4. Detailed Logging for Debugging:
    - Added request IDs to track operations across the codebase
    - Improved log messages with detailed connection state information
    - Enhanced error reporting with contextual information

  These changes should fix the issue where tool calls worked only for the first message in a conversation but failed for subsequent
  messages. The system now:

  1. Establishes a fresh connection for each request
  2. Properly tracks and cleans up connections
  3. Handles connection failures gracefully with automatic retries

  These improvements make the system more resilient in a serverless environment like Cloudflare Workers where maintaining persistent
  connections is challenging.
