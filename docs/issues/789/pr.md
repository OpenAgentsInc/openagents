# Pull Request Details

## Title
Implement GitHub MCP Tools Integration in Chat Server

## Body

### Summary
- Designed and implemented a centralized MCP client for the Chat Server
- Added support for GitHub tools discovery and execution
- Implemented secure authentication pass-through
- Created streaming tool results support
- Added comprehensive tests and documentation

### Implementation Details

This PR implements Issue #789 by integrating GitHub MCP tools into the OpenAgents chat server. The implementation establishes a reliable bridge between LLMs and GitHub operations through the MCP protocol.

#### Core Components

1. **McpClientManager**: Centralized client that connects to multiple MCP servers, discovers available tools, and routes tool calls to the appropriate server.

2. **Tool Handling**: Mechanism for:
   - Discovering tools from connected MCP servers
   - Converting tool definitions to LLM-compatible format
   - Processing tool calls from the LLM
   - Streaming tool results back to users

3. **Authentication Flow**: Secure pass-through of authentication tokens from client to MCP server without storing sensitive information.

4. **Streaming Support**: Real-time integration with the Vercel AI SDK for streaming both LLM responses and tool results.

#### Architectural Decisions

1. **Centralized Client**: Single point of management for all MCP connections to simplify connection handling and tool discovery.

2. **Server-side Integration**: Implementing the integration in the chat server enables future expansion to other MCP tool providers.

3. **Authentication Pass-through**: Tokens are passed directly to tool calls without being stored, maintaining security.

4. **Standalone Type Definitions**: Custom type interfaces ensure proper type safety throughout the implementation.

#### Files Changed

1. Created new files:
   - `/apps/chatserver/src/mcp/client.ts`: MCP client manager implementation
   - `/apps/chatserver/src/mcp/tools.ts`: Tool definition and execution utilities
   - `/apps/chatserver/src/mcp/tests/*`: Test files
   - `/docs/mcp-chat-integration.md`: Integration documentation
   - `/docs/issues/789/*`: Design documents, test information, and implementation summaries

2. Modified:
   - `/apps/chatserver/src/index.ts`: Enhanced to support MCP tool routing
   - `/apps/chatserver/package.json`: Updated dependencies and scripts
   - `/apps/chatserver/tsconfig.json`: Updated TypeScript configuration

#### Testing

Implemented comprehensive tests for:
- MCP client connection and tool discovery
- Tool definition extraction for LLMs
- Tool call processing and result handling
- Error handling in various scenarios

Run tests with:
```bash
cd apps/chatserver
yarn test
```

#### Documentation

- Added detailed architecture documentation
- Created test documentation
- Provided usage examples
- Documented authentication flow
- Added API reference

### Future Improvements

1. **Dynamic Tool Schema Conversion**: Automatically convert MCP tool schemas to LLM-compatible formats.
2. **Additional MCP Servers**: Extend support to other MCP tool providers beyond GitHub.
3. **Enhanced Authentication**: Support for OAuth flows and refresh tokens.
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Add instrumentation for monitoring tool usage and errors.
