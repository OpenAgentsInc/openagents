 I've made several key fixes to address the issues:

  1. Fixed Cloudflare Worker I/O Limitation Issues:
    - Changed the disconnect logic to just clear maps without attempting to close connections
    - This avoids the "Cannot perform I/O on behalf of a different request" error
    - Added unique request IDs to improve logging and error tracking
  2. Added Custom Tool Format Support:
    - Modified the system prompt to instruct Claude to use the <tool> format
    - Provided clear examples of how to format tool calls
    - This format can be detected and rendered by your ToolCall.tsx component
  3. Re-enabled Tool Support:
    - Reenabled tools and toolChoice in the streamText configuration
    - Activated toolCallStreaming to ensure proper streaming of tool calls

  These changes should solve both problems:

  1. The Cloudflare Worker I/O limitation is addressed by avoiding operations that try to reuse I/O objects across requests.
  2. The tool call display issue is addressed by instructing the model to format tool calls in a way that can be directly rendered by
  your UI.

  The key insight is that we need to work around both the Cloudflare Worker limitations and the format mismatch between the AI SDK's tool
   call format and what your UI component expects.

  Now when Claude needs to access GitHub content, it should:
  1. Use the <tool> format to make tool calls
  2. You should be able to parse these in your UI to show the ToolCall component
  3. The connection issues with Cloudflare Workers should be resolved
