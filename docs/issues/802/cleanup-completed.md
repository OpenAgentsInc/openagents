# Agents Package Cleanup Completed

## Actions Taken

The following cleanup actions have been completed on the `packages/agents` directory:

1. **Removed Frontend Components**:
   - Deleted `src/components/` and all subdirectories
   - Removed `src/hooks/` directory
   - Removed `src/providers/` directory

2. **Removed Frontend Entry Points**:
   - Deleted `index.html`
   - Removed `src/app.tsx`
   - Removed `src/client.tsx`
   - Removed `src/styles.css`

3. **Removed Static Assets**:
   - Deleted `public/` directory

4. **Fixed TypeScript Errors**:
   - Updated server.ts to use simpler agent routing
   - Fixed CoderAgent implementation to work with AIChatAgent base class
   - Removed unnecessary DurableObjectState type imports
   - Simplified routing logic to avoid type mismatches

5. **Updated Build Configuration**:
   - Modified `vite.config.ts` to remove frontend-specific plugins (React, Tailwind)
   - Configured build for server-side only

## Remaining Files

The following essential files remain in the `packages/agents/src` directory:

```
src/
├── coder-agent.ts - Specialized agent for coding tasks
├── coder-tools.ts - Tools specific to the CoderAgent
├── lib/
├── server.ts - Main worker entry point with routing logic
├── shared.ts - Shared constants and types
├── tools.ts - General agent tools
└── utils.ts - Utility functions
```

## Next Steps

1. Continue implementing the MCP integration in the CoderAgent tools
2. Configure the service binding in the chatserver
3. Test the integration between chatserver and agents
4. Deploy the worker service

The cleanup is now complete, and the agents package is ready for further development and integration.
