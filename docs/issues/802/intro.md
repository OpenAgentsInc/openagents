# Implementing Cloudflare Agents SDK with Coder Agent

## Overview

This document explains the plan for implementing the Cloudflare Agents SDK integration with a focus on creating a dedicated Coder agent as outlined in GitHub issue #802.

## Current State Analysis

After reviewing the project files, I've found that:

1. We've installed the Cloudflare `agents-starter` template in our `packages/agents` directory, which includes:
   - A complete frontend UI for chat (`app.tsx`, `client.tsx`, etc.)
   - Core agent implementation using Durable Objects (`server.ts`)
   - Tool definitions for the agent (`tools.ts`)
   - Build configuration for a standalone application

2. Our existing `chatserver` is a Cloudflare worker that:
   - Handles AI chat requests using the AI SDK
   - Connects to MCP servers for tool support (mainly GitHub tools)
   - Uses SSE (Server-Sent Events) for streaming responses
   
3. Our `coder` app is a desktop Electron application that needs specialized coding tools and capabilities

## Implementation Requirements

The implementation needs to:

1. **Remove Unneeded Frontend Components**: Strip out the standalone frontend from the agents package
2. **Configure Service Workers**: Set up the agents package as a standalone Worker service
3. **Create Service Bindings**: Connect chatserver to the agents service
4. **Implement Coder Agent Tools**: Create specialized coding tools for the Coder agent
5. **Integrate MCP**: Connect the agent tools with our existing MCP implementation
6. **Update Build Configuration**: Modify build scripts for our monorepo structure

## Coder Agent Implementation

The Coder agent will be a specialized agent for coding tasks that should:

1. **Assist with Code Development**: Provide tools for code generation, refactoring, and analysis
2. **Interface with GitHub**: Use the existing MCP GitHub integration for repository operations
3. **Handle File Operations**: Support file reading, writing, and traversal within projects
4. **Run Commands**: Execute shell commands for compiling, testing, and other development operations
5. **Support Long-Running Tasks**: Utilize the Cloudflare Durable Objects for persistent state

## Technical Architecture

The implementation will follow this architecture:

```
┌──────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐

                           │  MCP GitHub     │◀─────│   Coder Agent   │
                           │                 │      │                 │
                           └─────────────────┘      └─────────────────┘
```

1. Coder Desktop App: Sends requests to the Chat Server
2. Chat Server: Routes coding-related requests to the Agents Service
3. Agents Service: Hosts the Coder Agent implementation
4. Coder Agent: Uses tools that interact with MCP GitHub and other services

## Tool Implementation Plan

The Coder agent will need specialized tools that extend the basic tools in the starter template:

1. **Code Analysis Tools**:
   - Static code analysis
   - Dependency checking
   - Code quality assessment

2. **Repository Tools**:
   - Code search and navigation
   - Branch and commit management
   - PR creation and review

3. **Build Tools**:
   - Project compilation
   - Test execution
   - Package management

4. **Task Management Tools**:
   - Task scheduling and reminders
   - Progress tracking
   - Notifications

## Service Binding Configuration

The service binding configuration will allow the chatserver to securely communicate with the agents service:

```jsonc
// In chatserver's wrangler.jsonc
"services": [
  { 
    "binding": "AGENTS_SERVICE",
    "service": "agents"
  }
]
```

## Next Steps

1. Clean up the agents package to remove frontend components
2. Create a specialized CoderAgent class extending the base Chat agent
3. Implement Coder-specific tools that integrate with MCP
4. Configure service bindings between chatserver and agents
5. Add API endpoints in chatserver for interacting with the Coder agent
6. Test the integration with the Coder desktop app

## Issues and Challenges

1. **Environment Configuration**: Ensuring proper API keys and tokens are available across services
2. **Durable Object Persistence**: Managing state effectively for long-running coding tasks
3. **Cross-Service Authentication**: Securely passing authentication between services
4. **Tool Integration**: Connecting specialized coding tools with existing MCP functionality
5. **Error Handling**: Providing clear error messages and recovery mechanisms

## Timeline

1. Clean-up and configuration: 1 day
2. Coder agent implementation: 2 days 
3. Tool development: 2-3 days
4. Integration and testing: 1-2 days
