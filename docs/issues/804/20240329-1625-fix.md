‚è∫ Based on my analysis of the Cloudflare Agents SDK code and documentation, I've identified and fixed the issues:

  1. URL Pattern Fix: After analyzing the Agents SDK code and docs, I've confirmed that the correct pattern for WebSocket
  connections is /agents/{agent}/{instance}. I've updated the code to prioritize this pattern in the connection attempts.
  2. Connection Status Reporting: Fixed the issue where the UI was showing "connected" even when the connection failed. Now it
  correctly reports "disconnected" when the WebSocket connection fails.
  3. Operation Safety: Enhanced protection in various methods to check if the client is actually connected before attempting
  operations.
  4. Documentation Updates: Updated the documentation with detailed information about our findings, especially regarding the correct
   URL pattern and the meaning of the 500 error.

  The 500 error on the /agents/coderagent/default endpoint still needs to be fixed by the server team, but this is a server-side
  issue rather than a client-side problem. The error indicates that:

  1. The endpoint path is correct (it's recognized and returns 500, not 404)
  2. The Durable Object exists (the agent is registered)
  3. There's an implementation error in the WebSocket upgrade handler or Durable Object initialization

  The server team should check:
  - The implementation of the onConnect method in the CoderAgent class
  - Required environment variables (like OPENROUTER_API_KEY)
  - Any exceptions in the Worker code that handles WebSocket upgrades

  These changes make the client-side code robust and ready to use once the server-side issue is fixed.
