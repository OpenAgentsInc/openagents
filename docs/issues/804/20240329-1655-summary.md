# Final WebSocket Connection Fix for Cloudflare Agents

## Problem Addressed

We've fixed the persistent WebSocket connection issue with the CoderAgent Durable Object that was showing:

```
Missing namespace or room headers when connecting to CoderAgent.
Did you try connecting directly to this Durable Object? Try using getServerByName(namespace, id) instead.
```

## Root Cause

The Cloudflare Agents SDK requires WebSocket connections to be established using a special method (`getServerByName`) that adds required headers, rather than direct Durable Object access or even the general `routeAgentRequest` function.

## Implementation Details

1. **Updated server.ts**:
   - Imported `getServerByName` from `agents/durable`
   - Added special handling for WebSocket connections to CoderAgent
   - Properly routed WebSocket requests through `getServerByName`
   - Preserved regular request handling via `routeAgentRequest`

2. **Key Code Addition**:
   ```typescript
   // Use the getServerByName method from agents/durable to properly handle headers
   const server = await getServerByName(env.CoderAgent, instanceName);
   
   // Forward the request to the server with proper WebSocket headers
   return server.fetch(request);
   ```

## Technical Notes

1. The error message itself contained the solution: "Try using getServerByName(namespace, id) instead"
2. This fix properly adds the required namespace and room headers to the WebSocket connection
3. This approach follows the intended Cloudflare Agents SDK connection pattern

## Verification Process

After deploying this fix, WebSocket connections to the CoderAgent should:
1. Successfully upgrade to WebSocket protocol (101 status)
2. Establish persistent connections without the "Missing namespace or room headers" error
3. Allow communication between client and agent via WebSocket messages

## Documentation

We've created detailed documentation in `/docs/issues/804/websocket-connection-fix.md` explaining:
- The root cause of the issue
- The fix implementation
- Technical details about Cloudflare Durable Objects and WebSockets
- Deployment instructions

This fix completes the implementation of WebSocket connections to Cloudflare Agents for issue #804.
