‚è∫ I've fixed the crucial issue causing the WebSocket connections to fail. The client-side code is converting the agent name from
  "CoderAgent" to lowercase "coderagent", as shown in the error logs:

  agent-sdk-bridge.ts:128 Agent names should be lowercase. Converting CoderAgent to coderagent.

  The key fix:
  1. Changed the header x-cf-agent-namespace from 'CoderAgent' to 'agents' to match what the client expects
  2. Kept x-cf-agent-room as the instance name (typically 'default')

  These changes ensure that:
  1. The Durable Object receives the correct namespace and room headers for WebSocket connections
  2. The values match what the client-side code in agent-sdk-bridge.ts is expecting

  This should resolve the WebSocket connection failures. The client code uses lowercase "coderagent" but our Durable Object binding
  is "CoderAgent", which caused the mismatch.
