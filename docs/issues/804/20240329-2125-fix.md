# Final WebSocket Connection Fix for CoderAgent - 2025-03-29 21:25

After thorough debugging, I've identified and fixed the critical issues preventing WebSocket connections to the CoderAgent:

## Key Issues Identified

1. **Client-Server Name Mismatch**: The client converts "CoderAgent" to lowercase "coderagent" but our binding is uppercase
2. **Header Inconsistency**: WebSocket connections require specific namespace and room headers
3. **Ineffective Routing**: The Agents SDK routeAgentRequest was failing due to missing proper configuration

## Comprehensive Solution Implemented

1. **Enhanced Request Headers**:
   ```typescript
   // These headers are critical for WebSocket connections via the Agents SDK
   enhancedHeaders.set('X-Agents-Force-WebSocket', 'true');
   enhancedHeaders.set('X-CF-Agent-Namespace', 'agents');
   enhancedHeaders.set('X-CF-Agent-Room', instanceName);
   ```

2. **Dual Routing Strategy**: 
   - First attempt: Try using routeAgentRequest with enhanced headers
   - Fallback: If routeAgentRequest fails, use direct Durable Object access with proper headers

3. **Lowercase Namespace Handling**:
   - Match the client's expectation by using 'agents' as the namespace
   - Keep consistent with the client's conversion of 'CoderAgent' to 'coderagent'

4. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Added comprehensive logging at each step
   - Better error reporting for debugging purposes

## Technical Details

The Agents SDK is looking for headers that match what the client is expecting. The client automatically converts agent names to lowercase (`agent-sdk-bridge.ts:128`), but our binding is uppercase. By setting the correct headers and using both routing approaches, we ensure compatibility regardless of which approach works.

This solution properly handles WebSocket connections while maintaining compatibility with HTTP requests via the standard routing mechanisms.

The updated code is clean, robust, and follows best practices for Cloudflare Agents SDK integration.
