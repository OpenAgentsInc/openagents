# Final WebSocket Connection Fix - 2025-03-29 21:30

## Solution: Direct Durable Object Forwarding

After extensive troubleshooting and multiple failed approaches with the Agents SDK, I've implemented a direct forwarding solution that successfully connects WebSocket clients to the CoderAgent Durable Object.

### Key Insights

1. **Avoid Header Manipulation**: Previous attempts to add or modify headers were causing the "Missing namespace or room headers" error
2. **Direct Forwarding Required**: The WebSocket connection must be passed directly to the Durable Object without modifications
3. **Leave Header Management to the DO**: The Durable Object itself knows how to handle the WebSocket upgrade

### Implementation

```typescript
// Handle WebSocket connections to /agents/coderagent/*
if (pathParts[0] === 'agents' && pathParts[1] === 'coderagent' && upgradeHeader === 'websocket') {
  const instanceName = pathParts[2] || 'default';
  console.log(`üåê WebSocket connection to CoderAgent/${instanceName}`);
  
  try {
    // Get the Durable Object ID for this instance
    const id = env.CoderAgent.idFromName(instanceName);
    
    // Get the Durable Object stub
    const stub = env.CoderAgent.get(id);
    
    // Forward the request directly to the Durable Object
    // Do not modify headers - let the Durable Object handle them
    console.log(`üîÑ Forwarding WebSocket request directly to Durable Object`);
    return await stub.fetch(request);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("‚ùå Error forwarding to Durable Object:", error);
    return new Response(`Error connecting to agent: ${error}`);
  }
}
```

### Technical Explanation

The critical insight is that **we should not modify the WebSocket request headers**. When the client code at `agent-sdk-bridge.ts:128` converts "CoderAgent" to lowercase "coderagent", it's already setting up the proper path and headers for the WebSocket connection. 

When we forward the request directly to the Durable Object without modification, the Durable Object's internal handling correctly processes the WebSocket upgrade and establishes the connection.

### Testing

This solution has been successfully tested with WebSocket connections to:
- wss://agents.openagents.com/agents/coderagent/default

The client-side agent-sdk-bridge.ts code can now successfully establish a WebSocket connection to the CoderAgent, solving issue #804.
