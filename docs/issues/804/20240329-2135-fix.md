# Final WebSocket Connection Fix - 2025-03-29 21:35

## Solution: Follow the Exact Pattern from the Starter App

After multiple approaches, I've found the solution: the server.ts file must follow the exact minimalist pattern used in the Cloudflare Agents starter app.

### The Solution

```typescript
import { AsyncLocalStorage } from "node:async_hooks";
import { routeAgentRequest } from "agents";

// Import our CoderAgent
import { CoderAgent } from "./coder-agent";

// We use ALS to expose the agent context to the tools
export const agentContext = new AsyncLocalStorage<CoderAgent>();

// Export the CoderAgent class for the Durable Object
export { CoderAgent };

/**
 * Worker entry point that routes incoming requests to the appropriate handler
 */
export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext) {
    if (!env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY) {
      console.error(
        "OPENROUTER_API_KEY is not set, don't forget to set it using 'wrangler secret put OPENROUTER_API_KEY'"
      );
      return new Response("OPENROUTER_API_KEY is not set", { status: 500 });
    }
    
    return (
      // Route the request to our agent or return 404 if not found
      (await routeAgentRequest(request, env)) ||
      new Response("Not found", { status: 404 })
    );
  },
};
```

### What Was Wrong Before

1. **Overcomplication**: All previous approaches were trying to do too much - adding headers, manually forwarding requests, etc.
2. **Undocumented Requirements**: The Agents SDK has undocumented requirements about how it must be integrated
3. **Magic Routing**: The SDK's `routeAgentRequest` function handles all the routing magic internally

### Why This Works

The minimal approach works because:

1. We're exporting `CoderAgent` directly, making it available to the Cloudflare Workers runtime
2. `routeAgentRequest` handles all the complexity of routing requests to the correct Agent
3. We're not interfering with the request headers or routing logic

### Technical Details

The key insight is that the Agents SDK expects:
1. The Agent class to be exported directly from the module
2. No manipulation of request headers or objects
3. Simple delegation to `routeAgentRequest` without additional logic

This approach matches exactly how the Cloudflare Agents starter app works, and it's the only approach that reliably establishes WebSocket connections to our CoderAgent.
