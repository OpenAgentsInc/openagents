# Final WebSocket Connection Fix - 2025-03-29 21:40

## Solution: Fix the Case-Sensitivity Issue in Binding Names

After thorough investigation, I've identified the root cause of our WebSocket connection problems: a case-sensitivity mismatch between the Durable Object binding in wrangler.jsonc and the client-side agent name.

### The Critical Fix

1. Changed the binding name in wrangler.jsonc:
```diff
  "durable_objects": {
    "bindings": [
      {
-       "name": "CoderAgent",
+       "name": "coderagent",
        "class_name": "CoderAgent"
      }
    ]
  },
```

2. Kept the server.ts file simple and aligned with the example app:
```typescript
import { AsyncLocalStorage } from "node:async_hooks";
import { routeAgentRequest } from "agents";

// Import our CoderAgent
import { CoderAgent } from "./coder-agent";

// We use ALS to expose the agent context to the tools
export const agentContext = new AsyncLocalStorage<CoderAgent>();

// Export the CoderAgent class for the Durable Object
// IMPORTANT: This export name MUST match the class_name in wrangler.jsonc
export { CoderAgent };

/**
 * Worker entry point that routes incoming requests to the appropriate handler
 */
export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext) {
    if (!env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY) {
      console.error(
        "OPENROUTER_API_KEY is not set, don't forget to set it using 'wrangler secret put OPENROUTER_API_KEY'"
      );
      return new Response("OPENROUTER_API_KEY is not set", { status: 500 });
    }

    return (
      // Route the request to our agent or return 404 if not found
      (await routeAgentRequest(request, env)) ||
      new Response("Not found", { status: 404 })
    );
  },
};
```

### The Root Cause Explained

The client-side code in `agent-sdk-bridge.ts` automatically converts agent names to lowercase:
```
Agent names should be lowercase. Converting CoderAgent to coderagent.
```

However, our wrangler.jsonc had "CoderAgent" as the binding name. The Agents SDK is case-sensitive and looks for an exact match between:
1. The lowercase agent name in the URL (e.g., "coderagent")
2. The binding name in the environment (which we incorrectly had as "CoderAgent")

This mismatch was causing the error:
```
The url https://agents.openagents.com/agents/coderagent/default does not match any server namespace.
```

### Key Insights

1. **Binding Name Must Be Lowercase**: The binding name in wrangler.jsonc must match what the client sends (lowercase)
2. **Class Name Stays as Is**: The class_name remains "CoderAgent" to match our exported class
3. **Simple Integration Pattern**: Keep the server.ts file simple, just like the example app
4. **Consistent Routing**: Use routeAgentRequest without any custom headers or routing logic

This final solution properly aligns our server configuration with the client-side expectations, solving the WebSocket connection issue.
