‚è∫ I've fixed the RPC method issues for the CoderAgent. Here's what I did:

  1. Made all RPC methods properly async:
    - Updated the setProjectContext, getProjectContext, and getMessages methods to be properly async
    - Added comprehensive error handling with try/catch blocks
  2. Fixed the projectContext visibility issue:
    - Changed private projectContext to projectContext (public) so tools can access it
    - Updated coder-tools.ts to access agent.projectContext directly
  3. Enhanced the getMessages method:
    - Added logic to directly query the SQLite database
    - Added proper error handling and message parsing
    - Ensured proper type safety with String() conversions
  4. Created comprehensive documentation:
    - Added /docs/issues/804/rpc-method-fix.md explaining the issues and solutions
    - Included key insights about SDK requirements for RPC methods

  All TypeScript errors are now resolved, and the code should function correctly with the Agents SDK. The method calls should now
  complete successfully instead of timing out after 30 seconds.

  Should we deploy these changes and test them?
