Based on my analysis of the codebase, I can now explain why the project uses a custom agent-sdk-bridge instead of the official
  Agents SDK hooks. Here's what I found:

  1. The official Agents SDK is installed as a dependency ("agents": "^0.0.44" in package.json).
  2. The codebase has type definitions for the official SDK hooks in /packages/core/src/types/agents.d.ts, including useAgent from
  'agents/react'.
  3. However, the project implements a custom WebSocket bridge (agent-sdk-bridge.ts) instead of using the official hooks directly
  because:

    - Cross-platform compatibility: The custom bridge uses the browser's native WebSocket implementation, making it work in both
  browser and Node.js environments without requiring Node-specific dependencies.
    - Enhanced error handling: The custom implementation includes detailed error handling, logging, and retry mechanisms not
  available in the official SDK.
    - Connection management: It implements connection pooling, reconnection logic, and proper WebSocket lifecycle management with
  timeouts and fallbacks.
    - Automatic case normalization: The custom bridge automatically converts agent and instance names to lowercase, which matches
  what we found in our earlier troubleshooting.
  4. The useChat hook in /packages/core/src/chat/useChat.ts uses this custom bridge through the agent-connection.ts adapter, which
  provides a more React-friendly interface.
  5. This architecture gives the application more control over the connection process and error handling, at the cost of having to
  maintain a custom implementation that may diverge from the official SDK.

  To address why the project doesn't use the official hooks like useAgent directly:

  1. The official hooks may not have had all the features needed when this custom implementation was created.
  2. The project likely needed more control over connection management, error handling, and state persistence.
  3. The custom bridge provides better debugging capabilities with extensive logging.
  4. It offers better fallback mechanisms for different WebSocket endpoint patterns, which was crucial for diagnosing the case
  sensitivity issue.

  If you want to migrate to using the official hooks directly, you would need to:

  1. Replace the agent-sdk-bridge.ts implementation with direct imports from 'agents/react'
  2. Modify useChat.ts to use useAgent and useAgentChat from the official SDK
  3. Update agent-connection.ts or remove it entirely, depending on whether you need the additional utility functions

  This would simplify the codebase but might require adapting to any limitations of the official SDK compared to your custom
  implementation.
