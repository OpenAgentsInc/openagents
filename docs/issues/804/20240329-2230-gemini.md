Okay, I've reviewed the files. Here's the breakdown of how the official SDK integration was done and what needs attention:

1. useChat.ts - The Core Hook Implementation:

Good: It correctly imports and uses useAgent and useAgentChat from the official SDK (agents/react, agents/ai-react).

Good: It conditionally initializes agent using useAgent based on shouldUseAgent.

Good: It conditionally initializes agentChat using useAgentChat, passing the agent instance.

Good: The append function correctly uses agentChat.append(message) when the agent is active, which is the standard way to send messages via the official SDK hooks.

Needs Attention / Redundancy: It still heavily relies on agent-connection.ts, specifically createAgentUtils(agent). The agent object returned by useAgent already has the necessary methods like .call() for RPC and .close() for disconnection. The utils object created here is an extra layer wrapping these exact functions.

Example: utils.setProjectContext(...) eventually calls client.call('setProjectContext', ...), where client is the agent object. This could be simplified to agent.call('setProjectContext', ...).

Example: utils.disconnect() calls client.close(). This could be simplified to agent.close().

Needs Attention / Type Issue: The @ts-ignore for the headers option in useAgent confirms the previous analysis – either the type definitions for agents@0.0.44 are missing this property, or it's an undocumented feature being used.

Complexity: The hook still retains significant complexity around local command execution (localCommandExecution, safeExecuteCommand, intricate useEffect for processing assistant messages). This might be desired functionality, but it's intertwined with the agent logic.

2. agent-connection.ts - The Wrapper/Compatibility Layer:

Confirms: This file was not deleted but modified into a wrapper, as the log suggested.

Redundant: Functions like createAgentClient and createAgentConnection seem unnecessary now that components should use the useAgent hook directly.

Redundant (createAgentUtils): This function is the main source of the unnecessary abstraction layer. It takes the agent object (returned by useAgent) and returns an object with methods that simply call agent.call(...) or agent.close(). This adds no real value over using the agent object directly.

Good: It correctly re-exports useAgent and useAgentChat for convenience.

3. types.ts:

Confirms: The UIMessage type definition was updated to include StepStartUIPart, aligning with SDK structures. This looks correct.

4. package.json (core):

Confirms: "type": "module" is set.

Confirms: Dependencies on "@ai-sdk/react": "1.2.2", "agents": "^0.0.44", "partysocket": "^1.1.2" are present.

5. tsconfig.json (core):

Confirms: "module": "esnext" and "moduleResolution": "node". This configuration is often the source of type errors in modern Node/TypeScript projects using ESM, especially when interacting with dependencies that might have mixed module formats or complex export maps. The persistent type errors reported in the logs likely stem from this. Changing moduleResolution to "node16" or "bundler" might resolve these.

6. coder-agent.ts (Backend Agent):

Looks Good: The agent methods (setProjectContext, getProjectContext, getMessages) are correctly decorated with @unstable_callable and are async. They should work correctly when invoked via agent.call(...).

Looks Good: onChatMessage uses AIChatAgent, streamText, and tools (coderTools). It seems correctly set up to handle requests initiated by agentChat.append(...).

7. Documentation (sdk-integration.md, summary.md):

Accurate: They reflect the changes made, including the removal of the custom bridge and the (partial) integration of the official hooks, while acknowledging the wrapper layer (agent-connection.ts) remains.

Summary & Next Steps:

Success: The core part of the refactor did happen – useChat now uses useAgent and useAgentChat. This is the correct foundation.

Redundancy: The agent-connection.ts file, especially createAgentUtils, is unnecessary. It adds a layer of indirection without providing new functionality over the agent object itself. Recommendation: Refactor useChat.ts to directly use agent.call(...) for RPC methods (like setProjectContext, executeCommand, getMessages) and agent.close() for disconnection, then delete agent-connection.ts (or significantly gut it). This will simplify the code and remove potential confusion.

Timeouts: Using agent.call(...) directly relies on the SDK's built-in RPC-over-WebSocket mechanism, which should resolve the original timeout issues experienced with the custom bridge.

Type Errors: The remaining type errors are almost certainly caused by the tsconfig.json settings (module, moduleResolution). Recommendation: Try changing moduleResolution to "node16" or "bundler" in packages/core/tsconfig.json and re-run type checks (yarn workspace @openagents/core t). Address any new specific errors that arise. Fix the @ts-ignore if possible by checking SDK types or reporting an issue.

Local Commands: Consider if the complex local command execution logic within useChat.ts is still needed or if all command execution should ideally go through the agent via agent.call('executeCommand', ...).

Would you like to proceed with refactoring useChat.ts to remove the dependency on createAgentUtils and use agent.call() directly, and then tackle the type errors by adjusting tsconfig.json?
