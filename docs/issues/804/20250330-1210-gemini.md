Okay, you are absolutely right. The code you provided for the official `useAgentChat` reveals a significantly different internal structure and approach compared to how our custom `useChat` hook is currently implemented.

**Key Differences & Why We Should Align:**

1.  **Internal `useChat`:** The official `useAgentChat` *internally* calls `useChat` from `@ai-sdk/react`. Our custom hook calls it *separately* (`vercelUseChat`) and tries to layer agent logic on top.
2.  **`fetch` Override:** The official hook overrides the `fetch` function passed to the internal `useChat`. This custom `fetch` (`aiFetch`) cleverly tunnels the AI request/response over the *existing agent WebSocket connection* instead of making a separate HTTP request. This is likely much more efficient and avoids potential auth/header issues with a separate API endpoint. Our current hook doesn't do this; it uses `agentChat.append` which *might* do this internally, but our separate `vercelUseChat` call *doesn't* benefit from this tunneling when the agent isn't active.
3.  **Initial Messages:** The official hook uses React 19's `use()` hook to handle the async fetching of initial messages *before* initializing the internal `useChat`. This ensures messages are ready synchronously from `useChat`'s perspective. Our `useEffect` approach loads them *after* initialization, which can cause UI flashes or require extra loading state management.
4.  **State Synchronization:** The official hook explicitly listens for agent messages (`cf_agent_chat_clear`, `cf_agent_chat_messages`) to keep the client state synchronized *and* sends messages back to the agent when its `setMessages` or `clearHistory` are called. Our hook primarily relies on the messages *returned* by the `useAgentChat` instance and doesn't have this two-way explicit sync logic.

**Conclusion:** Yes, we should absolutely refactor our `useChat` hook to follow the official pattern more closely by directly using `useAgentChat` as the core. The current approach of running `vercelUseChat` and `useAgentChat` side-by-side and trying to merge them is overly complex and misses out on the benefits of the official hook's internal design (especially the WebSocket tunneling via `fetch` override).

**Refactoring Plan:**

1.  **Remove `vercelUseChat`:** Eliminate the separate call to `useChat` from `@ai-sdk/react`.
2.  **Use `useAgentChat` Directly:** Make `useAgentChat` the primary hook call when `shouldUseAgent` is true.
3.  **Handle Initial Messages (The Tricky Part):**
    *   We *still* need `getInitialMessages: null` because the default fetch causes CORS errors.
    *   The official hook's `use()` pattern won't work if we provide `null`.
    *   Therefore, the `useEffect` + `agent.call('getMessages')` + `setMessages` workaround remains the **most practical solution** for loading initial messages in our specific case *after* `useAgentChat` has initialized. We will apply this workaround directly to the `setMessages` function returned by our `useAgentChat` call.
4.  **Integrate Local Commands:** The `useEffect` that processes assistant messages for local commands needs to be adapted to work with the `messages` and `append` returned by the *single* `useAgentChat` instance (when the agent is active). When the agent is *not* active, this local command logic probably shouldn't run, or we need a fallback non-agent chat mechanism (which might justify keeping a *conditional* `vercelUseChat` call only for the non-agent case, but let's try to avoid that first).
5.  **Add Custom Utilities:** Layer our custom return values (`agentConnection`, `executeAgentCommand`, `fetchMessages`, `testCommandExecution`, debug properties) onto the return value of `useAgentChat`.

**Instructions for the Agent:**

1.  **Modify `useChat.ts`:**
    *   **Remove `vercelUseChat`:** Delete the line `const vercelChat = vercelUseChat(...)` and the subsequent destructuring (`const { messages: vercelMessages, ... } = vercelChat`).
    *   **Call `useAgentChat` Conditionally (or always, but use results conditionally):**
        *   Call `const agentChat = useAgentChat({ agent, getInitialMessages: null, ...otherOptions });` (Ensure this is called unconditionally respecting React hook rules).
        *   The results (`messages`, `append`, `setMessages`, `isLoading`, `error`, etc.) from `agentChat` will now be the **primary source** when `shouldUseAgent` is true.
    *   **Re-implement Initial Message Fetch:** Keep the `useEffect` that calls `agent.call('getMessages')`. Ensure it uses the `setMessages` function returned by *this `agentChat` instance* to populate the state. Verify the dependencies and the `initialMessagesFetchedRef` logic are correct.
    *   **Adapt Local Command Processing:** Modify the `useEffect` responsible for local command execution.
        *   It should **only run** if `localCommandExecution` is true AND `shouldUseAgent` is **false** (or `!agentConnection.isConnected`).
        *   If it needs to run, it will need a *fallback* chat state and append function, perhaps from a simplified, non-agent `useChat` call made *only* when `!shouldUseAgent`. Let's start simpler: **Disable local command processing entirely if `shouldUseAgent` is true for now.** We can add a non-agent fallback later if needed. If `shouldUseAgent` is false, we might need to conditionally call the original `vercelUseChat` just for that case.
    *   **Rebuild `returnValue`:** Construct the final return object.
        *   If `shouldUseAgent` is true, base it on the properties returned by `agentChat`.
        *   If `shouldUseAgent` is false, you'll need a source for `messages`, `append`, etc. (This might force us back to conditionally calling `vercelUseChat`). **Let's try this:**
            *   Always call `useAgentChat` but only *use* its results if `shouldUseAgent && agentConnection.isConnected`.
            *   *Also* always call `vercelUseChat` but only *use* its results if `!shouldUseAgent || !agentConnection.isConnected`. Select the active set of helpers based on the condition.
            *   This keeps hook calls unconditional.
    *   **Add Custom Utilities:** Add `agentConnection`, `executeAgentCommand`, `fetchMessages`, etc., to the `returnValue` as before.
    *   **Type Safety:** Re-apply the `Message` type import and use it where appropriate (especially for `setMessages`). Use `any` with `// TODO:` comments where type mismatches persist.

This is a more significant refactor, aiming for closer alignment with the SDK's intended structure. Focus on getting the agent path working first using `useAgentChat` directly and the message fetch workaround. Then figure out the non-agent path and local command execution.
