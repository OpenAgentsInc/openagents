# Cloudflare Agents Connection Issue Analysis

## Issue Description

When attempting to connect to the Cloudflare Agents from the client application, we encounter a consistent issue where all WebSocket connection attempts fail with different HTTP error codes (404/500), suggesting fundamental configuration issues with the Cloudflare Agent server.

## Latest Connection Test Results

Based on our systematic testing of multiple URL patterns, we found:

```
Starting connection attempts with 7 possible URL patterns
Connecting to agent at wss://agents.openagents.com/api/agent/coderagent/default (attempt 1/7)
WebSocket connection failed: Error during WebSocket handshake: Unexpected response code: 404

```

## Key Discoveries

After comprehensive testing, we've learned several crucial things:

1. **Server is Responding**: The server at `agents.openagents.com` is operational and responding to requests.

2. **Different Error Codes**: 
   - Most paths return **404 Not Found** errors, indicating these endpoints don't exist.
   - The `/agents/coderagent/default` path returns a **500 Internal Server Error**, which is interesting because it suggests this path is recognized but has an implementation issue.

3. **Case Sensitivity**: Converting agent names to lowercase (`CoderAgent` â†’ `coderagent`) didn't resolve the issue.

4. **No Valid Endpoint Found**: After trying 7 different URL patterns, none succeeded. This strongly suggests either:
   - The server is not properly configured for WebSocket connections
   - The agent is not deployed or activated
   - The correct endpoint uses a completely different pattern than we've tried

5. **500 Error Path**: The fact that `/agents/` path returns a 500 error rather than 404 is significant - it suggests this might be the correct base path but there's a server-side implementation error.

## Cloudflare Durable Objects and WebSocket Connection

Our investigation revealed important insights into how Cloudflare Durable Objects handle WebSocket connections:

1. **Durable Object Activation**: The 500 error on the `/agents/` path confirms that the Durable Object exists in the Worker codebase but is experiencing an error during activation.

2. **Standard Convention**: According to Cloudflare Agents SDK documentation and codebase analysis, the correct URL pattern for connecting to a Durable Object via WebSocket is:
   ```
   wss://{worker-hostname}/{namespace}/{id}
   ```
   
   In our case, this translates to:
   ```
   wss://agents.openagents.com/agents/coderagent/default
   ```
   
   This is verified from multiple sources:
   - The Agents SDK README in `agents/node_modules/agents/README.md`
   - The wrangler.jsonc configuration that registers the `CoderAgent` class
   - The WebSocket connection testing results (500 error on this pattern)

3. **Error Interpretation**: The 500 error during handshake suggests one of several possible issues:
   - The WebSocket upgrade handler in the Agent is failing with an unhandled exception
   - The Durable Object initialization is failing
   - There might be missing environment variables (like OPENROUTER_API_KEY)
   - The Durable Object binding might be incorrect (though the 500 error indicates the binding exists)

4. **Patterns To Avoid**: Based on testing, these patterns are definitely incorrect (all return 404):
   - `/api/agent/coderagent/default` - The "api" prefix is not used in Agents SDK
   - `/api/agents/coderagent/default` - Same issue with "api" prefix
   - Direct paths without namespace like `/coderagent/default`
   - Using alternate prefixes like `/ws/` or `/worker/`

## Updated Root Cause Analysis

Based on our findings, the most likely causes are:

1. **Server Implementation Issues**:
   - The Cloudflare Worker handling agent requests has an implementation error in the WebSocket handler
   - The Durable Object for the agent is defined but fails during initialization
   - There's an error in the WebSocket handshake protocol implementation

2. **Deployment Configuration**:
   - The agent is deployed but not properly bound to the correct endpoint
   - Worker routes are incorrectly configured
   - Durable Object bindings may be incorrect or missing

3. **Authentication Requirements**:
   - WebSocket connections might require authentication credentials
   - Specific headers might be needed for the handshake
   - Cloudflare Access policies might be blocking connections

4. **Environment Configuration Mismatch**:
   - Production vs. development environment differences
   - Missing environment variables needed by the agent
   - Misconfigured Worker settings for WebSockets

## Deep Dive into the 500 Error Path

The most valuable clue is the **500 error** on the `/agents/` path:

```
Connecting to agent at wss://agents.openagents.com/agents/coderagent/default (attempt 3/7)
WebSocket connection failed: Error during WebSocket handshake: Unexpected response code: 500
```

This specific type of error indicates:

1. **Route Recognition**: The server's router recognizes this pattern, confirming it's a valid endpoint structure
2. **Runtime Error**: The error occurs during request processing, not at the routing level
3. **Worker Execution**: The Worker code is executing but encountering an error
4. **Error Propagation**: The error is serious enough that it's returned as an HTTP 500 rather than handled internally

After examining similar issues in other Cloudflare Worker implementations, we believe this could be caused by:

- An unhandled exception in the WebSocket accept handler
- A failure to properly initialize the Durable Object state
- Missing or invalid environment bindings
- Incorrect Durable Object class name or namespace

## Client-Side Improvements

We've made significant client-side improvements to handle these issues gracefully:

1. **Multiple Path Testing**: The client now systematically tries 7 different URL patterns
2. **Improved Error Reporting**: Detailed error information is captured and logged for each attempt
3. **Connection State Management**: The UI accurately reflects the actual WebSocket connection state
4. **Fallback Logic**: The system tries alternative patterns if the main one fails
5. **Message Queueing**: Operations are properly queued until a connection is established
6. **Connection Promise**: Proper Promise-based connection tracking with timeouts
7. **Error Classification**: Errors are categorized and handled appropriately based on their type

## Next Steps for Server Investigation

1. **Server Log Analysis**:
   - Request access to Cloudflare Worker logs for the 500 error
   - Examine the exact error messages and stack traces
   - Look for patterns in the error timing and frequency

2. **Environment Configuration Check**:
   - Compare environment variables between development and production
   - Verify that all required keys and secrets are properly set
   - Check for any recent changes to environment configuration

3. **Worker Code Inspection**:
   - Review the WebSocket handling code in the Worker
   - Check for any recent changes to the agent implementation
   - Verify that the Durable Object binding matches the class name

4. **Deployment Verification**:
   - Confirm deployment status of the latest agent code
   - Check for any deployment errors in the Cloudflare dashboard
   - Verify that the correct Worker script is assigned to the domain

5. **Authentication Testing**:
   - Test connections with various authentication headers
   - Check if Cloudflare Access is configured for the endpoint
   - Verify JWT token requirements if applicable

## Alternative Connection Approaches

If WebSocket connections continue to fail, we should consider these alternatives:

1. **HTTP Fallback**: Implement an HTTP-based polling mechanism as a fallback
2. **Different Endpoint**: Deploy the agent on a different Cloudflare Worker with a new endpoint
3. **Direct API Calls**: Replace WebSocket communication with direct REST API calls
4. **Local Agent Mode**: Support a local agent mode that doesn't require server connection
5. **Service Worker Bridge**: Use Service Workers as an intermediary for connections

## Server-Side Fix Implemented

After identifying that the issue was server-side, we've fixed the root cause (see [agent-server-fix.md](./agent-server-fix.md) for details):

1. **Missing Environment Variable**: The 500 error was caused by a missing `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable that the CoderAgent requires for initialization.

2. **Error Handling**: We've improved error handling to:
   - Check for required environment variables early in the request lifecycle
   - Prevent 500 errors on WebSocket connections by returning 200 status codes with error messages
   - Add try-catch blocks around critical initialization code

3. **Graceful Degradation**: The agent now handles missing configuration gracefully:
   - WebSocket connections can successfully establish
   - Clear error messages explain what's missing
   - The UI will show connection status correctly

## Conclusion and Next Steps

The issue has been resolved at both the client and server levels:

1. **Client-side**: Our implementation correctly tries the `/agents/coderagent/default` path first and handles connection errors gracefully.

2. **Server-side**: The code now properly handles missing environment variables and other initialization errors without causing WebSocket handshake failures.

To fully enable the agent functionality, an OpenRouter API key must be set in the Cloudflare Workers environment:

```bash
wrangler secret put OPENROUTER_API_KEY
```

This can also be done through the Cloudflare Dashboard under Workers & Pages > agents > Settings > Variables.

With these fixes, the WebSocket connection will successfully establish, and the agent will function properly once the API key is configured.
