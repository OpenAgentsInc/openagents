# Final WebSocket Connection Fix for Cloudflare Agents

## Problem Solved

We've fixed the WebSocket connection issues with the CoderAgent that were causing the errors:

```
The url https://agents.openagents.com/agents/coderagent/default does not match any server namespace.
```

and 

```
Missing namespace or room headers when connecting to CoderAgent.
```

## Root Cause Identified

After extensive debugging, we identified that the core issue was a **case sensitivity mismatch** between the binding configuration and client expectations:

1. The client automatically converts agent names to lowercase:
   ```
   Agent names should be lowercase. Converting CoderAgent to coderagent.
   ```

2. Our wrangler.jsonc had the binding name as "CoderAgent" (uppercase) which didn't match the lowercase "coderagent" in URLs.

## Solution Implemented

1. **Binding Name Change**: Updated wrangler.jsonc to use lowercase binding name:

   ```diff
   "durable_objects": {
     "bindings": [
       {
   -     "name": "CoderAgent",
   +     "name": "coderagent",
         "class_name": "CoderAgent"
       }
     ]
   },
   ```

2. **Simplified Server Implementation**: Followed the example app pattern exactly:

   ```typescript
   import { AsyncLocalStorage } from "node:async_hooks";
   import { routeAgentRequest } from "agents";
   
   // Import our CoderAgent
   import { CoderAgent } from "./coder-agent";
   
   // We use ALS to expose the agent context to the tools
   export const agentContext = new AsyncLocalStorage<CoderAgent>();
   
   // Export the CoderAgent class for the Durable Object
   export { CoderAgent };
   
   /**
    * Worker entry point that routes incoming requests to the appropriate handler
    */
   export default {
     async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext) {
       if (!env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY) {
         console.error(
           "OPENROUTER_API_KEY is not set, don't forget to set it using 'wrangler secret put OPENROUTER_API_KEY'"
         );
         return new Response("OPENROUTER_API_KEY is not set", { status: 500 });
       }
       
       return (
         // Route the request to our agent or return 404 if not found
         (await routeAgentRequest(request, env)) ||
         new Response("Not found", { status: 404 })
       );
     },
   };
   ```

## Technical Background

The Cloudflare Agents SDK has some specific requirements for proper WebSocket connections:

1. Binding names in wrangler.jsonc must match the lowercase names used in URLs
2. The SDK's `routeAgentRequest` function handles all the routing complexity internally
3. Simple delegation to `routeAgentRequest` without additional logic is the recommended pattern

By matching the exact pattern used in the Cloudflare Agents starter app, we ensure compatibility with the SDK's internal handling of WebSocket connections.

## Deployment

Deploy the updated code with:

```bash
cd packages/agents
wrangler deploy
```

## Testing

Test the WebSocket connection by connecting to:
```
wss://agents.openagents.com/agents/coderagent/default
```

The connection should now be established successfully without any errors.
