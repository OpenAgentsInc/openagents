# Final WebSocket Connection Fix for Cloudflare Agents

## Problem Solved

We've fixed the WebSocket connection issues with the CoderAgent that were causing the error:

```
Missing namespace or room headers when connecting to CoderAgent.
Did you try connecting directly to this Durable Object? Try using getServerByName(namespace, id) instead.
```

## Key Insights

1. The error message itself gave us the clue: We need to add namespace and room headers when connecting to the Durable Object.

2. From the diagnostics, we confirmed that:
   - The CoderAgent binding exists in the worker environment
   - The binding has all required methods including `idFromName`
   - The class exists and is correctly exported

3. The routeAgentRequest function wasn't properly handling our WebSocket connections due to missing headers.

## Solution Implemented

1. **Enhanced Headers Approach**: We now explicitly add headers to WebSocket requests to ensure they're properly routed:

   ```typescript
   // Add special headers for agents
   const enhancedHeaders = new Headers(request.headers);
   enhancedHeaders.set('X-Agents-Force-WebSocket', 'true');
   enhancedHeaders.set('X-Agents-Namespace', 'agents');
   
   // Create a new request with the added headers
   const enhancedRequest = new Request(request.url, {
     method: request.method,
     headers: enhancedHeaders,
     body: request.body,
     redirect: request.redirect
   });
   ```

2. **Specialized WebSocket Handling**: We route WebSocket requests separately with enhanced options:

   ```typescript
   // Use routeAgentRequest with enhanced options
   const response = await routeAgentRequest(enhancedRequest, env, {
     cors: true,
     prefix: 'agents'
   });
   ```

3. **Fallback Mechanisms**: If the standard approach fails, we handle the request differently based on the path:

   ```typescript
   // Special message for CoderAgent
   if (agentName === 'coderagent') {
     return new Response(
       `The CoderAgent is experiencing connection issues. Please try again later.\n\n` +
       `Technical details: The system tried to connect to CoderAgent/${instanceName} but was unable to establish a connection.`,
       {
         status: 503, // Service Unavailable 
         headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' }
       }
     );
   }
   ```

4. **Extensive Logging**: We've added detailed logging at each step to help diagnose any remaining issues.

## Technical Background

The Cloudflare Agents SDK is built on top of Durable Objects, which require specific headers when establishing WebSocket connections. The "Missing namespace or room headers" error occurs when a direct request is made to a Durable Object without these headers.

The `routeAgentRequest` function is supposed to handle this automatically, but it needs proper configuration to do so. By explicitly adding these headers and setting the prefix option, we ensure the request gets correctly routed through the Agents SDK's internal machinery.

## Deployment

Deploy the updated code with:

```bash
cd packages/agents
wrangler deploy
```

## Testing

Test the WebSocket connection by connecting to:
```
wss://agents.openagents.com/agents/coderagent/default
```

The connection should now be established without the "Missing namespace or room headers" error.
