# Issue #804: WebSocket Connection to Cloudflare Agents

## Problem Statement

Implementation of WebSocket connections to Cloudflare Agents, specifically the CoderAgent for coding assistance, is needed for real-time communication with AI agents. However, attempts to connect to the CoderAgent via WebSocket were failing with the following errors:

1. `The url https://agents.openagents.com/agents/coderagent/default does not match any server namespace.`
2. `Missing namespace or room headers when connecting to CoderAgent.` 

This prevented the useChat hook from establishing real-time communication with the CoderAgent.

## Root Cause

After extensive debugging, we identified the core issue as a case sensitivity mismatch between different parts of the system:

1. The client-side code in `agent-sdk-bridge.ts` automatically converts agent names to lowercase:
   ```
   Agent names should be lowercase. Converting CoderAgent to coderagent.
   ```

2. Our wrangler.jsonc had the binding name as `CoderAgent` (uppercase), which didn't match the lowercase name used in URLs.

3. The Cloudflare Agents SDK expects an exact case-sensitive match between the URL path and the binding name in wrangler.jsonc.

## Completed Work

We have successfully resolved this issue by:

1. Making the binding name match the client expectations in wrangler.jsonc:
   ```diff
   "durable_objects": {
     "bindings": [
       {
   -     "name": "CoderAgent",
   +     "name": "coderagent",
         "class_name": "CoderAgent"
       }
     ]
   },
   ```

2. Simplifying the server.ts implementation to follow the example app pattern:
   ```typescript
   import { AsyncLocalStorage } from "node:async_hooks";
   import { routeAgentRequest } from "agents";
   import { CoderAgent } from "./coder-agent";
   
   export const agentContext = new AsyncLocalStorage<CoderAgent>();
   export { CoderAgent };
   
   export default {
     async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext) {
       return (
         (await routeAgentRequest(request, env)) ||
         new Response("Not found", { status: 404 })
       );
     },
   };
   ```

## Documentation Updates

We have created the following documentation to help with future Cloudflare Agents integration:

1. `final-solution.md` - Detailed explanation of the final solution
2. `cloudflare-agents-integration.md` - Integration guide for Cloudflare Agents SDK
3. `sdk-situation.md` - Overview of the Agents SDK requirements
4. `usage.md` - How to use the CoderAgent with WebSocket connections
5. `summary.md` - Summary of the issue, cause, and resolution

## Deployment

The fix has been deployed using the provided `deploy-fix.sh` script and has been verified working with WebSocket connections successfully connecting to the CoderAgent.
