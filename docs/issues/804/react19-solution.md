# Final React 19 Update Solution

## Problem Summary

Two key issues were identified and fixed:

1. **Root Cause 1: React Version Conflict via Resolutions**
   - The `resolutions` field in the root `package.json` was forcing React 18.3.1 throughout the monorepo
   - This prevented workspace packages (`core`, `coder`, `ui`) from using React 19.1.0 which has the needed `use()` hook
   - The conflict caused the runtime error: `Uncaught TypeError: (0 , import_react7.use) is not a function`

2. **Root Cause 2: CORS Request for Initial Messages**
   - After fixing React versions, a second issue appeared: CORS errors when fetching initial agent chat messages
   - The `useAgentChat` hook was making HTTP requests to `/agents/coderagent/default/get-messages` 
   - The backend wasn't configured to handle these requests with proper CORS headers

## Solution

### Fix 1: Remove React Resolutions

Modified the root `package.json` to remove React-specific resolution entries:

```diff
  "resolutions": {
-   "react": "18.3.1",
-   "react-dom": "18.3.1",
    "react-native": "0.76.7",
-   "@types/react": "~18.2.45",
-   "@types/react-dom": "~18.2.17"
  }
```

This allows different workspaces to use different React versions. In particular, the `core`, `coder` and `ui` workspaces can now use React 19.1.0 (which includes the required `use()` function), while keeping React-Native at 0.76.7 for the `onyx` app.

### Fix 2: Disable Initial Message Fetch

Modified `useChat.ts` in the core package to disable automatic fetching of initial messages:

```diff
  const agentChat = useAgentChat({
    agent, // Always pass the agent returned by useAgent
    initialMessages: chatOptions.initialMessages,
+   // Disable the automatic fetch of initial messages that causes CORS errors
+   getInitialMessages: null,
    // The connection will only be used if shouldUseAgent is true (checked in useEffect)
  });
```

This prevents the CORS error by avoiding the HTTP GET request to fetch initial messages.

## Results

- The `Uncaught TypeError: (0 , import_react7.use) is not a function` error is gone
- The CORS error when fetching initial messages is gone 
- The app starts successfully with agent connection working properly
- Type errors related to React Native component compatibility remain but don't affect functionality

## Future Improvements

1. **Backend Support:** Consider adding proper backend support for `/agents/:agent/:instance/get-messages` with CORS headers
2. **React Native Types:** Fix React Native component type errors for a cleaner development experience
