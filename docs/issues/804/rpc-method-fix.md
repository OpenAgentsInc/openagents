# Fixing RPC Method Issues in CoderAgent

## Problem

After implementing the WebSocket connection and adding the proper `@unstable_callable` decorators to methods, we were still experiencing timeout issues with RPC calls:

```
Failed to set project context: Error: Request timed out after 30s when calling method 'setProjectContext' on agent CoderAgent/default
```

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Asynchronous Method Handling**: Methods decorated with `@unstable_callable` need to be declared as `async` to properly handle RPC communication.

2. **Error Handling**: The methods needed better error handling to provide clear feedback on failures.

3. **Direct Access to Properties**: The tools were trying to access `getProjectContext()` which was causing issues because of asynchronous behavior.

4. **Project Context Visibility**: The `projectContext` property was private, preventing direct access from tools.

## Solution Implementation

1. **Made methods properly async**:
   ```typescript
   @unstable_callable({
     description: "Set the repository context for the coding agent"
   })
   async setProjectContext(context: {...}) {
     // Implementation
   }
   ```

2. **Added robust error handling**:
   ```typescript
   try {
     // Method implementation
     return { success: true, ... };
   } catch (error) {
     console.error("‚ùå Error:", error);
     return { success: false, error: String(error) };
   }
   ```

3. **Made projectContext public for tools**:
   ```typescript
   // Changed from private to public
   projectContext: {
     repoOwner?: string;
     repoName?: string;
     branch?: string;
     path?: string;
   } = {};
   ```

4. **Updated tools to access projectContext directly**:
   ```typescript
   // Get the context synchronously from the agent's instance property
   const context = agent.projectContext;
   ```

5. **Enhanced message retrieval**:
   ```typescript
   async getMessages() {
     try {
       // Query SQLite storage directly for maximum reliability
       const messages = this.sql`select * from cf_ai_chat_agent_messages...`;
       // Process and return messages
     } catch (error) {
       // Handle errors properly
     }
   }
   ```

## Key Insights

1. **SDK Requirements for RPC Methods**:
   - Must be decorated with `@unstable_callable`
   - Should be declared as `async` functions
   - Need proper error handling
   - Should return serializable data

2. **Access Patterns**:
   - Any properties accessed by tools should be public
   - Direct property access is more reliable than method calls for tool execution
   - SQLite access in the Agent provides reliable persistence

3. **Error Handling**:
   - All RPC methods should properly catch and report errors
   - JSON stringification is helpful for debugging objects in logs

## Results

The changes fixed the RPC timeout issues, enabling:
1. Successful setting of project context
2. Reliable message history retrieval
3. Proper persistence across connections

This completes the full implementation of issue #804, now with WebSocket connections, persistent messages, and functioning RPC methods.
