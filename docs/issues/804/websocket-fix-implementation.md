# WebSocket Connection Fix for Cloudflare Agents

## Problem Fixed

We fixed the WebSocket connection issue with the CoderAgent by entirely removing the dependency on the `routeAgentRequest` function from the `agents` package, which was causing the error:

```
The url https://agents.openagents.com/agents/coderagent/default does not match any server namespace. Did you forget to add a durable object binding to the class in your wrangler.toml?
```

## Solution Implementation

The key insight from the diagnostics was that:
1. The CoderAgent binding in the environment is working correctly
2. The CoderAgent class is properly exported and has all required methods
3. The routeAgentRequest function from the agents package was failing to recognize our URL pattern

### Changes Made

1. **Removed the agents SDK Dependency**:
   ```typescript
   // Removed this import
   import { routeAgentRequest } from "agents";
   ```

2. **Direct Durable Object Access**:
   We implement direct Durable Object access for WebSocket connections to avoid going through the failing `routeAgentRequest` function:

   ```typescript
   // For WebSocket connections to the CoderAgent, directly use the Durable Object
   if (upgradeHeader === 'websocket' && url.pathname.startsWith('/agents/coderagent')) {
     console.log(`🌐 Direct WebSocket connection to CoderAgent`);
     
     try {
       // Extract instance name from path (default to 'default' if not provided)
       const pathParts = url.pathname.split('/').filter(Boolean);
       const instanceName = pathParts.length > 2 ? pathParts[2] : 'default';
       
       // Get the Durable Object ID for the CoderAgent
       console.log(`🔑 Creating Durable Object ID for instance: ${instanceName}`);
       const id = env.CoderAgent.idFromName(instanceName);
       
       // Get the CoderAgent instance
       console.log(`🔍 Getting CoderAgent instance`);
       const agent = env.CoderAgent.get(id);
       
       // Forward the request to the CoderAgent Durable Object
       console.log(`🔄 Forwarding WebSocket request to CoderAgent`);
       return agent.fetch(request);
     } catch (doError) {
       // Error handling...
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Simplified HTTP Routing**:
   We also simplified the HTTP routing to use the same direct Durable Object access approach for consistency:

   ```typescript
   if (agentName === 'coderagent') {
     try {
       // Get the Durable Object ID
       const id = env.CoderAgent.idFromName(instanceName);
       // Get the CoderAgent instance
       const agent = env.CoderAgent.get(id);
       // Forward the request to the CoderAgent
       return agent.fetch(request);
     } catch (error) {
       // Error handling...
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Better Error Messages**:
   We've improved the error responses to provide clearer information about the available endpoints.

## Why This Works

The issue was that the `routeAgentRequest` function from the agents SDK was failing to map our URL pattern to the correct Durable Object. By directly accessing the Durable Object binding (which our diagnostics confirmed is properly set up), we bypass this routing layer altogether.

The CoderAgent class is correctly exported and properly bound in the worker environment, as confirmed by our diagnostics:
```
🔍 CoderAgent binding exists: true
📚 Available environment bindings: AGENT_ENV, AI, CoderAgent, OPENROUTER_API_KEY
🔧 CoderAgent methods: newUniqueId, idFromName, idFromString, get, jurisdiction, constructor
🔑 idFromName method exists: true
```

This direct approach is actually more in line with how Cloudflare Durable Objects are typically accessed in Workers, and it should provide better performance by eliminating an unnecessary routing layer.

## Deployment

Deploy the fixed code with:

```bash
cd packages/agents
wrangler deploy
```

## Testing

Test the WebSocket connection by connecting to:
```
wss://agents.openagents.com/agents/coderagent/default
```

You should now receive a proper WebSocket connection without the "Missing namespace or room headers" error.
