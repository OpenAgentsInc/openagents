# API Endpoint Fix for Chat Streaming

## Problem

Message streaming was failing because the API endpoint was incorrectly configured. The logs showed:

```
POST https://chat.openagents.com/api/chat 404 (Not Found)
ðŸ’¡ Server response received with status: 404
ðŸ’¡ URL requested: https://chat.openagents.com/api/chat
ðŸ’¡ SERVER ERROR: Response status indicates failure: 404
```

The API endpoint was incorrectly set to "https://chat.openagents.com/api/chat" when it should have been just "https://chat.openagents.com".

## Fix

1. The API endpoint in HomePage.tsx was already correctly set to:
```typescript
api: "https://chat.openagents.com",
```

2. We updated the default API endpoint in usePersistentChat.ts from:
```typescript
api: options.api || 'https://chat.openagents.com/api/chat',
```

to:
```typescript
api: options.api || 'https://chat.openagents.com',
```

## Impact

This fix enables proper streaming of assistant messages. Without this fix, the chat application would:
1. Show a brief loading spinner
2. Make a 404 request to the wrong API endpoint 
3. Fail to display any assistant messages

With the fix, the application can now:
1. Successfully connect to the correct API endpoint
2. Stream in assistant messages in real-time
3. Save completed messages to the RxDB database

## Testing

To verify this fix:
1. Send a message in the chat interface
2. Confirm you see the loading spinner
3. Verify that assistant messages stream in correctly
4. Check that messages persist between page reloads
