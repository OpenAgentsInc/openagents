# Code Cleanup: Debug Panel and Console Logs

## Debug Panel Removal

Removed the debug info panel from the UI in HomePage.tsx:

```jsx
{/* Debug info */}
<div className="p-2 mb-4 bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-yellow-900 rounded text-xs">
  <div className="font-bold">Debug Info:</div>
  <div>Messages: {messages.length}</div>
  <div>Is Loading: {isGenerating ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</div>
  <div>Thread ID: {currentThreadId}</div>
  <div>Current Messages: {JSON.stringify(messages.map(m => ({ id: m.id, role: m.role })))}</div>
</div>
```

This panel was useful during development to troubleshoot issues, but is no longer needed for production.

## Console Log Cleanup

The codebase had extensive debugging console logs added during the troubleshooting process. These have been removed for cleaner production code:

1. Removed logging in HomePage.tsx event handlers:
```typescript
// Before
onResponse: (response) => {
  console.log("ðŸ§© PERSISTENT - Response received:", response.status);
},
onFinish: (message) => {
  console.log("ðŸ§© PERSISTENT - Message finished:", message.id, message.role);
},
onThreadChange: (threadId: string) => {
  console.log(`ðŸ§© PERSISTENT - Thread changed to: ${threadId}`);
}

// After
onResponse: (response) => {},
onFinish: (message) => {},
onThreadChange: (threadId: string) => {}
```

2. Removed logging in usePersistentChat.ts:
   - Removed version logging at the top of the file
   - Cleaned up debugging logs in the hook initialization
   - Removed extensive logging in onResponse, onFinish, and append methods
   - Cleaned up diagnostics in message processing and state updates
   - Removed verbose logging throughout API calls and database operations

3. Statistics:
   - Removed 77 console.log statements
   - Reduced file size by about 100 lines
   - Preserved all functional code while removing diagnostic output

## Impact

The cleanup improves:

1. **Performance**: Removes unnecessary string concatenation and object serialization
2. **Security**: Reduces potential data exposure in logs
3. **Readability**: Makes the code easier to understand without diagnostic noise
4. **User Interface**: Removes development-only UI elements
5. **Professionalism**: Presents a clean, polished interface to users
