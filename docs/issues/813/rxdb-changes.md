# RxDB Implementation Changes

## Import Resolution

We encountered and resolved several issues with RxDB imports in the database initialization code. Here are the key changes made:

### 1. Plugin Simplification

Initially, we tried to import several RxDB plugins:
- Query Builder
- Migration
- Update
- Validate Storage

However, we discovered that some of these plugins were either not available or had different export names in RxDB v16.8.1. To resolve this, we simplified to use only the essential plugins:

```typescript
import { createRxDatabase, addRxPlugin } from 'rxdb';
import { getRxStorageDexie } from 'rxdb/plugins/storage-dexie';
import { RxDBQueryBuilderPlugin } from 'rxdb/plugins/query-builder';
```

### 2. Storage Configuration

We simplified the storage configuration by using `getRxStorageDexie()` directly instead of creating a custom storage wrapper:

```typescript
const db = await createRxDatabase<Database>({
  name: 'openagents',
  storage: getRxStorageDexie()
});
```

This replaced the more complex configuration that was causing issues:

```typescript
// Old approach (removed)
const dexieStorage = {
  name: 'dexie',
  async createDb(name: string) {
    const db = new Dexie(name);
    return db;
  }
};
```

### 3. Database Type Fix

We fixed the type issue with the database cleanup by properly extending the RxDB database type:

```typescript
export interface Database extends RxDatabase<DatabaseCollections> {
  destroy: () => Promise<void>;
}
```

This ensures that the `destroy` method is properly typed while maintaining all the base RxDB database functionality. The type now correctly reflects that our database instance has a `destroy` method that returns a Promise.

## Migration Strategy

For now, we've kept the migration strategy placeholders in place:

```typescript
migrationStrategies: {
  // Add migration strategies for future schema versions
  // 1: (oldDoc) => { ... }
}
```

These can be implemented as needed when schema changes are required in future versions.

### Next Steps

1. Consider adding back additional plugins as needed, ensuring proper typing and import paths
2. Test database operations to ensure CRUD functionality works as expected
3. Implement migration strategies when schema changes are needed
