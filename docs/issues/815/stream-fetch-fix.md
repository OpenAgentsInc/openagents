# Fixing Streaming Response in Electron-AI Integration

## Issue

The AI SDK in the Electron app was having trouble handling the streaming response created by the custom `fetch` implementation that bridges between the renderer process and the main process via IPC.

Key symptoms:
- The log `HomePage.tsx:114 Response is event-stream: undefined` indicated that the `content-type` header was not being properly accessed in the renderer process
- Despite the server correctly setting the headers (`content-type: text/event-stream; charset=utf-8`), the AI SDK couldn't properly identify and handle the streaming response

## Solution

The solution involved a fundamental redesign of the IPC approach:

### 1. Plain Data Transfer in Preload Script (`fetch-context.ts`)

Instead of trying to create a Response object in the preload script, we:

- Created a `PlainResponseData` type to represent the data structure
- Made the preload's `electron.fetch` return a simple serializable object
- Removed all Response/Headers/ReadableStream creation from the preload script
- Added extensive logging for easier debugging
- Ensured all necessary fields are included in the plain data object

### 2. Response Construction in Renderer (`HomePage.tsx`) 

We completely rewrote the custom fetch function to:

- Receive plain data from the preload script
- Construct a proper Response object entirely within the renderer context
- Create proper Headers objects from plain header data
- Create ReadableStream instances for streaming responses
- Set all standard Response properties correctly
- Provide extensive validation and error handling

## Implementation Details

The key improvement is in our handling of complex Web API objects through IPC:

### Preload Script Changes

1. Defined a `PlainResponseData` type to ensure type safety
2. Simplified the preload script to just pass data, not construct complex objects
3. Focused on ensuring all fields are properly included in the data object
4. Added extensive logging to track data flow

### Renderer Changes

1. Reconstructed proper DOM API objects entirely within the renderer context
2. Created a proper `Headers` object from the plain headers data
3. Created an appropriate `ReadableStream` for streaming responses
4. Set all standard Response properties consistently
5. Added detailed validation to ensure all parts of the Response are working

## Testing

To test these changes:
1. Restart the Electron application
2. Check the console logs for proper header propagation
3. Verify that AI responses appear in the UI
4. Confirm that streaming responses work end-to-end

## Future Improvements

- Consider providing a simple mock EventSource implementation in the preload script
- Add more robust error handling specifically for SSE connection issues
- Implement retry logic for intermittent IPC failures
