# Issue #815: AI SDK Streaming Response Fix

## Problem

The AI SDK was unable to properly handle streaming responses bridged through Electron's IPC mechanism, resulting in a generic "Error" when trying to use the chat interface. While the server was correctly setting up a streaming response with the appropriate headers, the client-side SDK couldn't properly detect and handle it.

## Root Cause Analysis

The core issue was that the `Response` object created in the preload script wasn't fully compliant with the fetch API specification that the AI SDK expects. In particular:

1. The `content-type` header was not being properly accessed via the `headers.get()` method
2. The headers created in the preload script weren't properly serializable across the IPC boundary
3. The `forEach` method on the Headers object was not functioning correctly after IPC transfer
4. The `ReadableStream` implementation was incomplete
5. The response URL and other properties weren't being correctly set

This caused the SDK to fail when trying to determine if the response was a streaming response (checking headers) and when trying to set up the EventSource connection.

## Solution

The solution involves a complete redesign of the IPC approach:

1. **Plain Data Transfer**: Instead of trying to pass complex objects like `Response` and `Headers` through IPC, the preload script now returns plain data objects that can be safely serialized.

2. **Renderer-side Response Construction**: The renderer's fetch function now reconstructs proper `Response` objects within its own context, ensuring all methods and properties work as expected.

## Key Changes

- Complete redesign of the IPC data flow:
  - Preload script now returns a plain data object instead of a Response
  - Renderer constructs the Response object locally using this data
- Added type safety with explicit `PlainResponseData` type
- Created proper DOM objects (Headers, ReadableStream, Response) entirely in the renderer context
- Enhanced error handling with detailed logging for diagnostic purposes
- Ensured proper streaming response detection via content-type headers
- Improved renderer-side validation of received data

## Testing

Test the changes by:
1. Restarting the Electron application
2. Opening the DevTools console to monitor logs
3. Sending a message in the chat interface
4. Verifying that a streaming response is received and displayed correctly

## Next Steps

- Consider implementing a more robust SSE client-side implementation for better error handling
- Add more comprehensive testing for network edge cases
- Document the IPC-bridged fetch implementation for future reference
