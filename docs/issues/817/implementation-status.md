# Model Selection Implementation Status

## Completed Tasks

1. **Core Components Created**:
   - `ModelSelect`: Created a ShadUI dropdown for model selection
   - `ModelsPage`: Created a settings page for model and API key management
   - UI components index for better importing

2. **Routes Added**:
   - Added `/settings/models` route

3. **HomePage Updates**:
   - Integrated model selection dropdown in header
   - Added navigation to settings page in sidebar
   - Connected model selection to chat functionality

4. **Settings Integration**:
   - Leveraged existing settings repository functionality
   - Used models data from core package

## Type Error Fixes

Fixed type errors related to our model selection implementation:
- Fixed `Chart` export in components index
- Fixed `SheetPortal` and `SheetOverlay` exports 
- Fixed `SidebarMenu` and `SidebarMenuButton` component props

## Existing Issues (Not Related to Our Implementation)

The following type errors exist in the codebase but are not related to our model selection implementation:

```
src/main.ts(85,44): error TS2339: Property 'server' does not exist on type 'ServerType'.
  Property 'server' does not exist on type 'Server<typeof IncomingMessage, typeof ServerResponse>'.
src/main.ts(86,24): error TS2339: Property 'server' does not exist on type 'ServerType'.
  Property 'server' does not exist on type 'Server<typeof IncomingMessage, typeof ServerResponse>'.
src/main.ts(86,44): error TS7006: Parameter 'error' implicitly has an 'any' type.
src/server/server.ts(100,66): error TS2339: Property 'id' does not exist on type 'Omit<StepResult<ToolSet>, "stepType" | "isContinued"> & { readonly steps: StepResult<ToolSet>[]; }'.
../../packages/core/src/chat/usePersistentChat.ts(284,20): error TS2454: Variable 'timeoutId' is used before being assigned.
```

These errors would need to be addressed separately as they pertain to the server implementation and the persistence chat hook.

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Test model selection functionality in a running application to ensure it works as expected.

2. **Refinements**:
   - Add per-thread model persistence
   - Improve error handling for API key issues
   - Add model capability comparison UI

3. **Documentation**: Update application documentation with model selection instructions.

## Implementation Decisions

1. We kept the changes focused on the exact requirements of issue #817.
2. We leveraged existing settings and repository functionality to avoid duplicating code.
3. We used ShadUI components to maintain design consistency.
4. We organized models by provider for better management and UX.
