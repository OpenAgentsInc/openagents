# Summary of Issue #817 Fixes

## Issue Description

Issue #817 involved multiple challenging problems in the OpenAgents codebase:

1. RxDB collection limit errors in React Strict Mode (16 collections maximum)
2. Settings not being saved or persisted between application sessions
3. Document conflicts in RxDB leading to update failures
4. Schema validation errors when trying to update documents
5. Model selection in the homepage not respecting user choices

## Implementation Details

Our solution tackled these issues through a comprehensive set of changes:

### Database Creation Improvements

- Added mutex-style locking pattern for database creation to prevent concurrent initialization
- Implemented a fixed database name structure that's consistent within development sessions
- Added error recovery mechanisms for when collection limits are hit
- Improved database cleanup for when issues occur

### Settings Repository Enhancements

- Fixed RxDB document updates to strictly adhere to schema requirements
- Implemented proper atomic updates with RxDB that respect revision history
- Added multiple fallback mechanisms when primary update methods fail
- Created a multi-layered persistence strategy with RxDB, localStorage, and sessionStorage
- Added comprehensive error handling that preserves user settings even during failures

### Model Selection Logic

- Created a priority system for model selection:
  1. User-selected models (via dropdown)
  2. Models stored in localStorage (across tabs)
  3. Models stored in sessionStorage (current tab)
  4. Default models from settings

- Ensured model selections in the homepage dropdown persist across sessions
- Fixed the model update UI to avoid disruptive page reloads

## Key Files Modified

1. `/packages/core/src/db/database.ts` - Database creation and management
2. `/packages/core/src/db/repositories/settings-repository.ts` - Settings persistence
3. `/apps/coder/src/pages/HomePage.tsx` - Model selection behavior
4. `/apps/coder/src/pages/settings/ModelsPage.tsx` - Settings page UI and updates

## Technical Approach

The core approach focused on:

1. **Synchronization:** Ensuring only one process accesses a resource at a time
2. **Schema Compliance:** Strict adherence to RxDB's schema requirements
3. **Multi-Layer Storage:** Fallbacks to prevent data loss
4. **Priority System:** Clear hierarchy for resolving conflicting data sources
5. **Error Resilience:** Comprehensive error handling with sensible defaults

## Results

After these changes:

- RxDB collection limit errors are gone
- Settings persist reliably between sessions
- Document conflicts are handled gracefully
- Schema validation errors no longer occur
- Model selection works properly with the expected priority order
- The application maintains user choices consistently

These improvements significantly enhance the stability and user experience of the OpenAgents application, making it more reliable and predictable.
