# Model Selection Implementation Summary

## Overview

Issue #817 requested adding model selection capabilities to OpenAgents, enabling users to choose between various AI models and manage their API keys. This feature is a critical part of the Coder MVP, providing flexibility and customization for users.

## Components Implemented

1. **Model Selection Dropdown** in the chat header
   - Allows quick switching between models
   - Shows model details and capabilities
   - Connected to the chat functionality

2. **Comprehensive Settings Page** for models
   - Default model selection
   - API key management for different providers
   - Detailed model information

3. **Sidebar Navigation** to access model settings
   - Easy access from the main interface
   - Clear organization of settings

## Technical Implementation

The implementation leverages existing infrastructure:

1. **Settings Repository**: Used for storing API keys and preferences
2. **Models Data**: Comprehensive model definitions with metadata
3. **TanStack Router**: Added new route for the settings page
4. **ShadUI Components**: Consistent design language throughout

All UI components follow the ShadUI design system, maintaining the application's aesthetic and providing a cohesive user experience.

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Intuitive Model Selection**: Users can easily switch models from the header
2. **Secure API Key Management**: Keys are stored securely with visibility control
3. **Detailed Model Information**: Descriptions, context lengths, and capabilities are clearly displayed
4. **Provider Organization**: Models are grouped by provider for easier navigation

## Next Steps

While the current implementation provides a solid foundation for model selection, future enhancements could include:

1. **Per-Thread Model Persistence**: Remember model choices for each conversation
2. **Usage Analytics**: Track token usage across different models
3. **Custom System Prompts**: Per-model system prompt configurations
4. **Enhanced Filtering**: More advanced filtering options for model selection

## Conclusion

The implementation of model selection addresses a key need for OpenAgents, allowing users to leverage different AI models according to their preferences and requirements. The solution is robust, user-friendly, and built on existing architectural patterns.
