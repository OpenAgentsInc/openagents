# Model Grid: Design Decisions

## Architecture Overview

The Model Grid feature required a significant redesign of the model selection system while maintaining backward compatibility. Here are the key design decisions and their rationales:

## 1. Database Schema Evolution

**Decision**: Add new fields while maintaining the old ones
- Added `selectedModelId` alongside `defaultModel`
- Added `visibleModelIds` as a new array field

**Rationale**: 
- Ensures existing code continues to work
- Allows for gradual migration rather than a hard cutover
- Prevents data loss during schema transition

## 2. Optimistic UI Updates

**Decision**: Implement optimistic updates for model selection and visibility
- Update local UI state immediately before saving to the database
- Revert to previous state if the database operation fails

**Rationale**:
- Provides immediate feedback to users
- Prevents UI lag during database operations
- Enhances perceived performance

## 3. Fallback Strategy

**Decision**: Implement a robust fallback strategy
- If `visibleModelIds` is empty, show all models
- If `selectedModelId` is missing, fall back to `defaultModel`
- If both are missing, use the first available model

**Rationale**:
- Ensures the app remains usable even with partial or corrupted settings
- Provides a seamless experience for users upgrading from older versions
- Minimizes the risk of edge cases causing app failures

## 4. Tabbed Interface

**Decision**: Implement a tabbed interface in the settings page
- Separate "Models" and "API Keys" into distinct tabs
- Previously these were separate cards on the same page

**Rationale**:
- Provides more screen space for the model grid
- Creates a cleaner, more focused UX
- Allows users to focus on one task at a time

## 5. Safety Constraints

**Decision**: Implement safety constraints on model visibility
- Prevent hiding the currently selected model
- Require at least one model to remain visible
- Automatically make a selected model visible if it was hidden

**Rationale**:
- Prevents users from creating unusable states
- Avoids confusion when a selected model isn't visible
- Maintains a consistent and logical user experience

## 6. Migration Path

**Decision**: Automatic migration of existing settings
- Convert `defaultModel` to `selectedModelId` on first load
- Populate `visibleModelIds` with a sensible default (top 5 models)

**Rationale**:
- Makes the transition seamless for existing users
- Provides reasonable defaults without requiring user intervention
- Allows for incremental adoption of the new features

## 7. Grid Over List

**Decision**: Use a data table/grid instead of a list view
- Provides sortable columns
- Shows more information at once
- Allows for more efficient scanning of models

**Rationale**:
- Better utilizes screen space
- Provides more powerful organization options
- Creates a more professional, data-driven interface

## Performance Considerations

- Used React state for immediate UI feedback
- Implemented efficient filtering and sorting on the client side
- Took advantage of browser storage for redundancy and persistence
- Minimized DB writes by batching updates where possible

## Future Extensibility

The design leaves room for future enhancements:
- Support for model categories and tagging
- Personalized model recommendations
- Usage statistics and favorites
- Custom model groupings

This architecture balances backward compatibility with forward-looking features, ensuring a smooth transition while providing significant UX improvements.
