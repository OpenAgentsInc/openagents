# Model Grid Feature Summary

## Overview

The Model Grid feature enhances the OpenAgents user experience by providing more flexibility and control over model selection. It replaces the simple "default model" concept with a more sophisticated system that allows users to:

1. **Select** their current active model
2. **Show/Hide** models in the selection dropdown
3. **Search, filter, and sort** the available models

## Business Value

This feature delivers several benefits:

1. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: By hiding rarely-used models, users can focus on models they actually use
2. **Improved Organization**: The grid view provides a clear, sortable overview of all available models with details
3. **Enhanced Control**: Users can now customize their model selection experience to match their workflow
4. **Better Model Discovery**: The search and filter capabilities make it easier to find models with specific capabilities

## Technical Implementation

The implementation strikes a balance between providing new functionality while maintaining backward compatibility:

- Added new database fields (`selectedModelId`, `visibleModelIds`) while preserving existing ones
- Created repository methods specifically for model management
- Updated UI components to respect visibility settings
- Implemented safeguards to prevent invalid states (e.g., hiding all models)

## Future Expansion Possibilities

This feature lays the groundwork for several potential future enhancements:

1. **Model Categories/Tags**: Group models by capability or use case
2. **Custom Model Groups**: Allow users to create their own collections of models
3. **Usage Statistics**: Track and display which models are used most frequently
4. **Recommended Models**: Suggest models based on the current task or user history

## Conclusion

The Model Grid transforms model selection from a simple dropdown to a powerful management interface. It exemplifies how thoughtful UX improvements can enhance productivity while maintaining compatibility with existing systems. Users now have greater agency in organizing their AI model experience while enjoying a cleaner, more focused interface.
