# Model Grid: Usage Guide

The Model Grid is a new feature that gives you more control over which AI models are displayed in the model selection dropdown. This document explains how to use this feature effectively.

## Accessing the Model Grid

1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Models
2. You'll see the new Model Grid interface, which displays all available models in a table format

## Key Features

### Model Selection

The "Select" column allows you to choose which model will be used for new conversations:

- Click the checkmark button to select a model
- The currently selected model is highlighted with a filled checkmark
- Selecting a model automatically makes it visible in the dropdown if it wasn't already

### Model Visibility

The "Show" column lets you control which models appear in the model selection dropdown:

- Models with the eye icon (üëÅÔ∏è) are visible in the dropdown
- Models with the slashed eye icon (üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è) are hidden from the dropdown
- Click the eye icon to toggle visibility

### Restrictions

There are some limitations in place to maintain a functional user experience:

- You cannot hide the currently selected model
- You must keep at least one model visible at all times

### Searching and Filtering

The search box at the top of the grid lets you quickly find models:

- Search by name, provider, author, or ID
- The grid updates in real-time as you type

### Sorting

You can sort the grid by clicking on column headers:

- Click once to sort ascending
- Click again to sort descending
- The arrow icon indicates the current sort direction

## Model Selection Dropdown

After configuring your model visibility:

- Only visible models will appear in the model selection dropdown throughout the app
- This helps reduce clutter and make it easier to find your preferred models
- If you need a model that's not visible, you can always return to the Model Grid to make it visible

## Resetting to Defaults

If you need to start over:

- Click the "Reset All Settings" button at the bottom of the Model Grid
- This will restore the default set of visible models and reset the selected model
- Note that this also resets all other settings, including API keys

## Tips for Optimal Use

1. **Focus on what you use**: Keep only the models you regularly use visible in the dropdown
2. **Group by provider**: Consider keeping one representative model from each provider visible
3. **Select before hiding**: Always select your preferred model before hiding others
4. **Use search for quick access**: Instead of scrolling through the grid, use the search box to quickly locate models
5. **Remember that hiding isn't deleting**: Hidden models are still available - you can make them visible again at any time
