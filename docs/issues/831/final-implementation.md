# Ollama Provider Integration - Final Implementation

## Changes Made

1. **Added Dependencies**:
   - Added the `ollama-ai-provider` package to the coder app
   - Created type declarations for the package in `src/types/ollama-ai-provider.d.ts`

2. **Server.ts Updates**:
   - Added imports for the Ollama provider
   - Extended environment interface to include `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`
   - Implemented dynamic provider selection based on model configuration
   - Added Ollama client initialization with configurable base URL
   - Modified stream options to use the appropriate provider

3. **Type Definitions**:
   - Created type definitions for the `ollama-ai-provider` package
   - Ensured TypeScript compatibility throughout the implementation

4. **Documentation**:
   - Created detailed implementation documentation
   - Added usage guide for configuring and using Ollama
   - Provided a summary of the changes and benefits

## Testing

The implementation has been type-checked and is ready for testing. To fully test this implementation:

1. Start a local Ollama server (`ollama serve`)
2. Pull a test model (`ollama pull gemma3:12b`)
3. Start the OpenAgents Coder application
4. Select the Ollama model from the UI
5. Verify that the model responds correctly

The implementation leverages the existing MODELS array configuration, which already includes one Ollama model (`gemma3:12b`), and the Model interface already supports the `provider` field.

## Next Steps

1. Add more Ollama models to the MODELS array for a richer selection
2. Enhance the UI to show which provider is being used
3. Add more detailed error handling for Ollama-specific issues
4. Consider caching mechanisms for improved performance

The implementation is now complete and ready for review and testing.
