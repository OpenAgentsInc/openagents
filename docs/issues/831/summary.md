# Ollama Provider Integration - Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds Ollama provider support to OpenAgents Coder, allowing users to interact with both cloud-based models via OpenRouter and local/remote models via Ollama, all through a unified interface.

## Key Features

1. **Provider-aware Model Selection**:
   - Models in the MODELS array specify their provider (`openrouter` or `ollama`)
   - Server dynamically selects the appropriate client based on the model's provider

2. **Configurable Ollama Endpoint**:
   - Default: `http://localhost:11434/api` for local Ollama instances
   - Custom: Configurable via `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` environment variable for remote instances

3. **Graceful Fallbacks**:
   - Clear error messages when required API keys are missing
   - Appropriate provider selection based on model configuration

4. **Tool Support**:
   - Maintains MCP tool integration for models that support tools
   - Works with both OpenRouter and Ollama providers

## Technical Implementation

1. **Client Creation**:
   ```typescript
   // Create Ollama client with configurable base URL
   const customOllama = createOllama({
     baseURL: OLLAMA_BASE_URL,
   });
   ```

2. **Dynamic Provider Selection**:
   ```typescript
   // Determine provider based on model info
   if (provider === "ollama") {
     model = customOllama(MODEL);
   } else if (provider === "openrouter") {
     model = openrouter(MODEL);
   }
   ```

3. **Unified Streaming Interface**:
   All providers use the same Vercel AI SDK streamText interface, maintaining a consistent experience regardless of the underlying provider.

## Benefits

1. **Increased Flexibility**: Users can choose between cloud models and local/remote open-source models
2. **Reduced Dependency**: Local models can be used without an OpenRouter API key
3. **Performance Options**: Local models may offer lower latency for some use cases
4. **Cost Savings**: Local models don't incur API usage costs
5. **Privacy**: Sensitive conversations can be kept local when required

## Future Enhancements

1. **Provider-Specific Options**: Add support for provider-specific configuration options
2. **Dynamic Model Discovery**: Automatically discover available Ollama models
3. **UI Indicators**: Add visual indicators in the UI to show which provider is being used
4. **Fallback Logic**: Implement intelligent fallback between providers if one is unavailable

This implementation successfully addresses Issue #831 by adding support for the Ollama provider, expanding OpenAgents' flexibility and capability while maintaining compatibility with existing OpenRouter integration.
