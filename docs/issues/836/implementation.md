# Implementation of Issue 836: Settings Layout Refactoring

## Changes Made

### 1. Refactored SettingsLayout.tsx
- Changed to use the same sidebar-based layout as MainLayout:
  - Replaced the horizontal tabs with vertical sidebar items
  - Implemented proper sidebar navigation with active state indicators
  - Added appropriate icons for each settings section
  - Maintained the same styling and structure as the main chat interface

### 2. Key Components Used
- `SidebarProvider` - Provides the sidebar context for the layout
- `Sidebar`, `SidebarHeader`, `SidebarContent`, `SidebarFooter` - Structure components
- `SidebarMenu`, `SidebarMenuItem`, `SidebarMenuButton` - Navigation components 
- `SidebarInset` - Main content area component

### 3. Navigation
- Converted horizontal tabs to vertical navigation items in the sidebar
- Used `isActive` prop on SidebarMenuButton to highlight the current page
- Retained all routes to the individual settings pages
- Added descriptive icons for each settings option

### 4. Back to Chat Button
- Replaced the "Coder 0.0.1" text with a "Back to Chat" button in the sidebar header
- Used the ArrowLeft icon to indicate navigation back to the main chat

### 5. Main Content Area
- Preserved the outlet for rendering individual settings pages
- Added a header bar that shows the current page title
- Maintained consistent styling with the main chat interface
- Used appropriate spacing and width constraints for content readability

## Technical Notes

1. No changes were needed to the individual settings pages (ModelsPage, LocalModelsPage, PromptsPage, PreferencesPage) as they receive their content area from the layout.

2. No change to routes was needed, as the routing structure already supported this layout change.

3. The sidebar implementation follows the same pattern as MainLayout, which makes the application more consistent and maintainable.

4. Used the same styling and component structure for:
   - The sidebar
   - The header
   - The content area
   - The navigation indicators

## Testing Checklist

- [x] All navigation links work correctly
- [x] "Back to Chat" button returns to the main chat interface
- [x] Current page is highlighted correctly in the sidebar
- [x] Content area displays properly
- [x] Styling matches the main chat interface
- [x] Responsive behavior matches MainLayout

## Benefits of the Change

1. **Consistency**: Users now have a consistent UI experience throughout the application
2. **Familiarity**: The navigation pattern is now the same across the entire app
3. **Maintainability**: Using the same component structure makes the code more maintainable
4. **Scalability**: Adding new settings sections will be easier and more consistent
