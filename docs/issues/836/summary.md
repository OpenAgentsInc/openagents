# Summary of Work Completed for Issue #836

## Fixes Applied
1. Fixed an issue with missing Lucide icon export:
   - Replaced the non-existent `Prompt` icon with `MessageSquare` icon for the Prompts section
   - Updated all related references in the component

## Original Problem
The settings layout was inconsistent with the main chat interface:
- Used horizontal tabs instead of a sidebar
- Had a different visual structure
- Lacked the consistent navigation pattern used elsewhere in the app
- Had a simple "Back to Chat" link instead of matching the main UI's pattern

## Solution Implemented
1. **Complete Refactor of SettingsLayout.tsx**:
   - Replaced the horizontal tab navigation with a vertical sidebar
   - Structured the layout to match MainLayout exactly
   - Added appropriate icons for each settings section
   - Created a "Back to Chat" button in the sidebar header
   - Maintained the header and content area patterns from MainLayout

2. **Key Components Used**:
   - `SidebarProvider` - For sidebar state management
   - `Sidebar`, `SidebarHeader`, `SidebarContent`, `SidebarFooter` - For sidebar structure
   - `SidebarMenu`, `SidebarMenuItem`, `SidebarMenuButton` - For navigation items
   - `SidebarInset` - For the main content area

3. **Improvements**:
   - More consistent user experience across the application
   - Better visual hierarchy for settings navigation
   - Clearer indication of the current settings section
   - More cohesive application design
   - Easier navigation between settings sections
   - Same responsive behavior as the main interface

## Files Changed
Only one file needed to be modified:
- `/apps/coder/src/pages/settings/SettingsLayout.tsx`

## Documentation Created
To document the changes and provide context:
- `intro.md` - Initial analysis of the issue
- `implementation.md` - Technical details of the implementation
- `testing.md` - Testing steps to validate the changes
- `changelog.md` - Changelog entry for this feature
- `README.md` - Overview of the work done
- `summary.md` - This summary document

## Technical Decisions
1. **No Route Changes Required**: The existing routing structure worked well with the new layout approach
2. **No Changes to Individual Settings Pages**: The content pages worked correctly with the new layout
3. **Reused Same Components**: Used the same components and patterns as MainLayout for consistency
4. **Added Active State Indicators**: Highlighted the currently active settings section in the sidebar

## Result
The settings layout now matches the main chat interface, providing a consistent user experience across the application. All functionality has been preserved, but the layout is now more intuitive and cohesive with the rest of the application.
