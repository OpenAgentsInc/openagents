# MCP Client Configuration Implementation

## Changes Summary

I've implemented user-configurable MCP client settings with the following components:

1. **Data Model**:
   - Added `MCPClientConfig` interface to the settings schema
   - Extended the `Settings` interface to include an array of MCP client configurations

2. **MCP Clients Module**:
   - Refactored to use dynamic configurations from settings repository
   - Added functions for adding, updating, and deleting client configurations
   - Implemented status tracking for each client
   - Added ability to reinitialize clients when configurations change

3. **API Layer**:
   - Created REST API endpoints for MCP client operations
   - Implemented proper validation and error handling
   - Added routes for operations like reinitializing clients

4. **UI Interface**:
   - Created a new `MCPClientsPage` component for the settings UI
   - Implemented forms for adding and editing client configurations
   - Added status indicators and refresh capabilities
   - Designed a responsive and intuitive interface

## Implementation Details

### Data Model Updates

The most significant change was extending the settings data model to support MCP client configurations:

```typescript
export interface MCPClientConfig {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  enabled: boolean;
  type: 'sse' | 'stdio';
  url?: string; // For 'sse' type
  command?: string; // For 'stdio' type
  args?: string[]; // For 'stdio' type
  env?: Record<string, string>; // For both types
  lastConnected?: number;
  status?: 'connected' | 'disconnected' | 'error';
  statusMessage?: string;
}

export interface Settings {
  // ... existing fields
  mcpClients?: MCPClientConfig[]; // MCP client configurations
}
```

### MCP Clients Module Refactoring

The `mcp-clients.ts` module was completely refactored to:
- Load configurations from the settings repository
- Initialize clients based on their configurations
- Update client status in settings
- Provide functions for managing configurations

Key new functions:
- `ensureMCPClientConfigs()`: Creates default configs if none exist
- `updateClientStatus()`: Updates client status in settings
- `initMCPClient()`: Initializes a client based on configuration
- `addMCPClient()`: Adds a new client configuration
- `updateMCPClient()`: Updates an existing configuration
- `deleteMCPClient()`: Removes a client configuration
- `reinitializeClient()`: Reconnects a specific client
- `reinitializeAllClients()`: Reconnects all clients

### API Layer

Created a new `mcp-api.ts` module with these endpoints:
- `GET /api/mcp/clients`: Get all client configurations
- `POST /api/mcp/clients`: Add a new client
- `PATCH /api/mcp/clients/:id`: Update a client
- `DELETE /api/mcp/clients/:id`: Delete a client
- `POST /api/mcp/clients/:id/refresh`: Refresh a specific client
- `POST /api/mcp/refresh`: Refresh all clients

### Settings UI

Created a comprehensive settings page with:
- List of configured clients with status indicators
- Add/edit/delete functionality for clients
- Type-specific forms for SSE and stdio clients
- Environment variable configuration support
- Enable/disable toggles for each client
- Refresh functionality to reconnect clients

## Future Considerations

1. **Connection Health Monitoring**: Add periodic health checks for clients
2. **Automatic Retry Logic**: Implement retry logic for failed connections
3. **Tool Discovery**: Add visual indication of which tools are provided by each client
4. **Client Templates**: Provide pre-configured templates for common MCP clients
5. **Security Enhancements**: Add validation for commands and environment variables
