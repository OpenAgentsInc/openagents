# Implementation Log for Issue #848 - Initialization Refactor

This log tracks the steps taken to implement the refactoring plan outlined in `analysis_and_plan.md`.

*   Created implementation log file.
*   Refactored `apps/coder/src/main.ts`:
    *   Added single instance lock (`app.requestSingleInstanceLock`).
    *   Created main `initializeApp` orchestrator function.
    *   Modularized init steps (MCP, Server, Window, Tray, Menu, Extensions) into separate functions.
    *   Corrected MCP client init timing (removed `setTimeout`, placed before server start).
    *   Added basic `console.time` profiling.
    *   Added placeholders for Database init/cleanup in main process.
    *   Verified `activate` handler.
    *   Improved shutdown sequence in `will-quit`.
*   **[Current]** Moved Database initialization to Main Process:
    *   Created `apps/coder/src/main/dbService.ts`.
    *   Adapted core DB logic from `packages/core` for main process.
    *   Switched storage from Dexie (IndexedDB) to LokiJS (Filesystem) via `getRxStorageLoki`.
    *   Adjusted environment checks (`app.isPackaged`), logging, and cleanup for Node.js.
    *   Integrated `dbService.ts` into `main.ts` initialization flow.
    *   Added IPC channel (`get-db-status`) for renderer to check DB readiness.
    *   Updated preload context (`dbStatusContext`) to expose IPC channel.
    *   Modified `HomePage.tsx` to remove direct DB init and use IPC status check.
