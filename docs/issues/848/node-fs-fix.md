# Node.js Native Modules for Electron Packaging Fix

## Problem

When packaging the Electron app with Electron Forge, we encountered a persistent error:

```
Error: Cannot find module 'fs-extra'
Require stack:
- /path/to/app.asar/.vite/build/main-XXXX.js
- /path/to/app.asar/.vite/build/main.js
```

Multiple approaches were attempted to fix the issue with fs-extra using ASAR unpacking and externalization, but none were successful.

## Solution: Replace fs-extra with Native Node.js Modules

Instead of trying to make fs-extra work in the packaged app, we've completely removed the dependency on fs-extra and replaced it with native Node.js modules that are guaranteed to be available in Electron's Node.js runtime.

### Changes Made:

1. **Removed fs-extra Dependency**
   - Removed from package.json
   - Removed all import/require statements for fs-extra

2. **Replaced with Native Node.js Modules**
   - Used `import fs from 'node:fs'` and `import { mkdir } from 'node:fs/promises'`
   - Replaced `fs.ensureDirSync(dir)` with `fs.mkdirSync(dir, { recursive: true })`
   - Replaced `fs.pathExists(path)` with `fs.existsSync(path)`

3. **Fixed Build Configuration**
   - Simplified Vite's external modules config to only include standard Node.js modules
   - Set ASAR config to a simple boolean (`asar: true`) to avoid pattern-related errors

4. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Added more robust error handling around file operations
   - Made errors non-fatal in development mode to allow the app to start regardless

## Why This Approach Works

Using native Node.js modules has several advantages:

1. **No External Dependencies**: Native modules are part of the Electron runtime
2. **Guaranteed Availability**: No need to worry about bundling or unpacking
3. **Consistent Behavior**: Same behavior across development and production
