# Implementation Log for Issue #852: Server Refactoring and Error Handling

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation of the server refactoring and error handling improvements for issue #852. The goal was to break down the monolithic `server.ts` file into smaller, more manageable components and implement a robust, typed error handling system.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Core Error System

The first phase involved creating a comprehensive error class hierarchy in the `packages/core/src/chat/errors/` directory:

- **Base Error Classes**: Created base `ChatError` class with common functionality for error serialization and client formatting
- **Error Categories**: Defined specialized error categories (provider, validation, tool, network, limit, system)
- **Provider Errors**: Implemented provider-specific error classes for Anthropic, OpenRouter, Google, and Ollama
- **Validation Errors**: Added error classes for input validation, message format validation, and API key validation
- **Tool Errors**: Created specialized errors for tool execution failures, authentication issues, and timeouts
- **Network Errors**: Added classes for connection issues, timeouts, and HTTP status errors
- **Limit Errors**: Implemented error classes for context length, rate limits, and quota issues
- **Error Transformers**: Created utility functions to transform raw provider errors into our typed system

The error system provides standardized error responses, better error classification, and improved user feedback.

### 2. Server Modularization

The second phase involved breaking down the monolithic `server.ts` file into smaller, more focused modules:

- **Provider Modules**: Created individual provider implementations for Anthropic, Google, OpenRouter, and Ollama
- **Streaming Utilities**: Extracted streaming logic into `stream-manager.ts` and `response-formatter.ts`
- **Route Handlers**: Created dedicated route handlers for chat and MCP endpoints
- **Tool Utilities**: Extracted tool execution code for shell commands and MCP integration
- **Error Handling**: Implemented consistent error formatting and recovery mechanisms
- **Validation**: Created utilities for request validation, message normalization, and model validation

Each module is now responsible for a specific aspect of the server's functionality, making the codebase more maintainable.

### 3. Improved Error Handling

The new error handling system provides several key improvements:

- **Typed Errors**: All errors are now properly typed, providing better compile-time checks
- **Consistent Classification**: Errors are categorized by type (provider, validation, tool, etc.)
- **Detailed Information**: Errors include useful information like provider type, model ID, and status codes
- **User-Friendly Messages**: All errors include both technical details and user-friendly explanations
- **Custom Formatting**: Errors are consistently formatted for SSE streams and JSON responses
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Implemented recovery strategies for certain error types

### 4. Error Transformers for Provider-specific Errors

Added specialized transformers for each provider's error format:

- **Anthropic Transformer**: Handles Claude-specific error types and formats
- **Google Transformer**: Processes Gemini API errors appropriately
- **OpenRouter Transformer**: Manages the unique error responses from OpenRouter
- **Ollama Transformer**: Handles local model errors and connectivity issues

Each transformer converts raw provider errors into our typed error system, ensuring consistent handling and user feedback.

## Code Structure Before vs After

### Before:
- `server.ts`: ~1100 lines with mixed responsibilities
- Error handling spread throughout the file with string-based pattern matching
- Global state for error tracking
- Inconsistent error propagation

### After:
- `server.ts`: ~40 lines, delegates to modular components
- `routes/*.ts`: Dedicated route handlers
- `providers/*.ts`: Provider-specific implementations
- `streaming/*.ts`: Stream management and formatting
- `tools/*.ts`: Tool execution utilities
- `utils/*.ts`: Validation and helper functions
- `errors/*.ts`: Error handling and formatting
- `packages/core/src/chat/errors/*.ts`: Core error system

## Benefits of the New Architecture

1. **Improved Maintainability**:
   - Each file has a clear, single responsibility
   - Smaller files are easier to understand and modify
   - Better separation of concerns

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Typed errors provide better safety and documentation
   - Consistent error formatting improves user experience
   - Error recovery mechanisms improve resilience

3. **Better Testability**:
   - Modular components can be tested in isolation
   - Clear interfaces between components
   - Reduced dependencies between modules

4. **Future Extensibility**:
   - Adding new providers is straightforward
   - Error handling can evolve independently
   - New features can be added with minimal changes to existing code

## Testing Strategy

The refactoring includes improvements to the codebase's testability:

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Provider implementations can be tested in isolation
   - Error transformers can be tested with mock error objects
   - Validation utilities can be tested with sample requests

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Chat API endpoint can be tested with various model types
   - Error handling can be tested with mocked provider errors
   - Recovery mechanisms can be tested with simulated failures

3. **End-to-End Testing**:
   - Complete chat flows can be tested against real providers
   - Tool execution can be tested with simulated environments
   - UI integration can ensure errors are properly displayed

## Conclusion

The refactoring substantially improves the codebase quality, maintainability, and error handling. The new architecture provides clear separation of concerns, typed error handling, and better extensibility for future features.
