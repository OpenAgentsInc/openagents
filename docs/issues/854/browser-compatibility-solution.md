# Fixing Browser Compatibility for MCP Tools

## Problem Overview

After implementing the configurable tool selection feature, we encountered significant browser compatibility issues that prevented MCP tools from functioning correctly in web browsers (as opposed to the Electron app):

1. **Module Import Errors**: The code attempted to use ES Module imports for Node.js-specific packages like `ai/mcp-stdio` which don't have browser-compatible versions
2. **Content Security Policy Violations**: Inline scripts used for loading and error handling were violating the site's strict CSP
3. **Black Screen on Production Build**: These issues combined to cause a completely black screen in the production build

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Direct Node.js Module Imports**: The MCP client implementation was directly importing Node.js modules without environment checking
2. **Shimming Approach Failed**: Our initial approach of creating shims for Node.js modules created more complex issues with export mismatches
3. **Inline Scripts in HTML**: The loading/error handling relied on inline scripts that violated CSP

## Comprehensive Solution

### 1. Conditional Module Loading

Rather than trying to shim Node.js modules, we implemented proper conditional module loading:

```typescript
// Conditionally import MCP modules only in Node.js environment
let experimental_createMCPClient: any = null;
let StdioMCPTransport: any = null;

// Only attempt to import in Node.js environment
if (typeof window === 'undefined') {
  try {
    // Dynamic require for Node.js environment only
    const ai = require('ai');
    experimental_createMCPClient = ai.experimental_createMCPClient;
    
    const mcpStdio = require('ai/mcp-stdio');
    StdioMCPTransport = mcpStdio.Experimental_StdioMCPTransport;
  } catch (e) {
    console.warn('MCP modules could not be loaded:', e);
  }
}
```

### 2. Environment-Aware Client Implementation

We rewrote the `initMCPClient` function to be fully environment-aware:

```typescript
async function initMCPClient(config: MCPClientConfig): Promise<any | null> {
  // Check for browser environment first
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    console.log(`[MCP Clients] Browser environment detected - using mock client for: ${config.name}`);
    
    // Return a mock client with necessary methods
    return {
      tools: async () => {
        // Return mock tools for browser environment testing
        return {
          'github_search': {
            name: 'GitHub Search',
            description: 'Search GitHub repositories',
            // ... parameter definitions
          },
          'github_repo': {
            name: 'GitHub Repository Info',
            description: 'Get information about a GitHub repository',
            // ... parameter definitions
          }
        };
      }
    };
  }
  
  // Node.js environment implementation...
}
```

### 3. Fixed CSP Issues in HTML

1. **Removed Inline Scripts**: Moved all inline scripts to external files
2. **Created External Loader**: Implemented a proper loader script with error handling
3. **Improved Error Display**: Added visible error states with recovery options

```html
<!-- External loader script to comply with CSP - intentionally not a module -->
<script src="/src/shims/loader.js"></script>
```

### 4. Simplified Approach to Node.js Modules

Rather than trying to create complex shims for Node.js modules, we simplified to:

1. **Removed Unnecessary Shims**: Deleted complex shims that tried to recreate Node.js APIs
2. **Environment Detection**: Added clear environment detection at key points
3. **Mock Implementations**: Provided useful mock implementations for browser contexts

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Cleaner Separation**: Clear separation between Node.js and browser environments
2. **Better Debugging**: More explicit error handling and logging
3. **Improved UX**: User sees appropriate feedback rather than blank screens
4. **Simpler Code**: More maintainable code that follows best practices
5. **Forward Compatibility**: Easier to add future tooling since the foundation is solid

## Testing Verification

The solution has been tested and verified in:
- Electron desktop app (development and production)
- Web browser (development and production)
- Various scenarios with MCP tools enabled/disabled

## Future Recommendations

1. **Environment-First Approach**: Always design with environment compatibility in mind
2. **CSP Compliance**: Avoid inline scripts entirely in HTML files
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Design features to work with gracefully degraded functionality in limited environments
4. **Feature Detection**: Use feature detection rather than environment detection where possible
