# Fix for Build Issues and Debug Overlay in Issue #854

## Issues Fixed

1. **Rollup Configuration Fix**
   - Fixed duplicate `rollupOptions` in `vite.renderer.config.mts`
   - Consolidated the external definitions and output configuration into a single rollupOptions object
   - This resolves build errors that occurred due to conflicting configuration

2. **Debug Overlay Improvements**
   - Modified the debug message overlay to be toggleable
   - Added user control to easily dismiss or hide the debug info
   - Ensures production users aren't confused by technical debugging information

## Technical Details

### Vite Configuration Fix

The `vite.renderer.config.mts` file had duplicate `rollupOptions` configurations which were conflicting:

```typescript
// Before: Two separate rollupOptions blocks
build: {
  rollupOptions: {
    plugins: [],
    external: [ /* ... */ ]
  },
  assetsInlineLimit: 0,
  minify: false,
  sourcemap: true,
  rollupOptions: { // <-- Duplicate configuration
    output: { /* ... */ }
  },
}
```

Fixed by consolidating into a single unified configuration:

```typescript
// After: Single unified rollupOptions
build: {
  assetsInlineLimit: 0,
  minify: false,
  sourcemap: true,
  rollupOptions: {
    plugins: [],
    external: [ /* ... */ ],
    output: { /* ... */ }
  },
}
```

### Debug Overlay Improvements

The debug overlay in `loader.js` has been enhanced with toggle functionality:

- Added a dismiss button to remove the overlay
- Implemented localStorage persistence to remember user preference
- Kept the critical debugging features while improving user experience

## Testing Notes

These changes have been tested in both development and production environments to ensure:

1. The build process completes successfully without rollup errors
2. The debug overlay is functional but doesn't interfere with normal usage
3. Users can easily dismiss debugging information when not needed

## Future Recommendations

1. **Build Configuration Best Practices**
   - Use explicit configuration structure to avoid duplicates
   - Add comments to clarify the purpose of each configuration section
   - Consider using TypeScript interfaces to validate configuration objects

2. **Debugging Infrastructure**
   - Continue the pattern of toggleable debug features
   - Consider implementing different debug levels (error-only, verbose, etc.)
   - Add a dedicated debug section in settings to control these features
