# Implementation Summary for Issue #854

## Initial Problem
The tool selection component had several issues:
1. Tool selection wasn't visually updating (toggling) when clicked
2. Selected tools weren't being properly sent to the server
3. MCP tools weren't being properly displayed in the UI

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Tool Selection Toggling
- Fixed state management in the ToolSelect component by replacing `localSelectedToolIds` with `internalSelection`
- Added explicit re-rendering with `forceRender` state
- Improved checkbox UI with better visual feedback

### 2. Fixed Tool Selection API Communication
- Fixed how selected tools are passed to the API in ChatInputArea.tsx
- Created a proper `body` structure in submission options
- Added enhanced server-side tool filtering
- Added special handling for empty tool selection ([])

### 3. Fixed MCP Tools Display
- Created new API endpoints for fetching MCP tools:
  - GET `/api/mcp/tools` - Retrieves all available MCP tools
  - POST `/api/mcp/tools/refresh` - Refreshes MCP tools
- Updated ToolSelect component to fetch tools via API instead of direct client access
- Added refresh functionality with status indicator
- Added better error handling and fallbacks

### 4. Enhanced UI Experience
- Added refresh button to the tool select dropdown
- Added status indicator showing when tools were last refreshed
- Added detailed console logging for better debugging
- Improved empty state with refresh option

## Key Changes

1. **Server-Side API Endpoints**:
   - Added `/api/mcp/tools` endpoint to expose server-side MCP tools
   - Added `/api/mcp/tools/refresh` endpoint to refresh MCP tools

2. **ToolSelect Component**:
   - Replaced direct MCP client access with API calls
   - Added refresh functionality
   - Fixed state management issues
   - Enhanced UI with better visual feedback

3. **Tool Selection Communication**:
   - Fixed structure of API requests to include selected tools properly
   - Added server-side handling for empty tool selection

## Testing

The tool selection component now works correctly:
1. All available MCP tools from registered clients show up in the dropdown
2. Tools can be selected and deselected with proper visual feedback
3. Selected tools are properly sent to the server
4. The UI provides feedback on tool status and refreshing

## Next Steps

1. Consider adding tool caching to improve performance
2. Implement automatic tool refreshing at certain intervals
3. Add user notifications for tool status changes
