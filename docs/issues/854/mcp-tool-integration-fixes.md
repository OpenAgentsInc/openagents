# MCP Tool Integration Fixes

## Summary
This document outlines the comprehensive fixes made to improve MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool integration in the OpenAgents application. These changes ensure that tools from connected MCP servers are properly displayed, selected, and used in chat interactions.

## Problem Statement
Several issues were identified with the MCP tool integration:

1. **Tool Selection Component Issues**:
   - Tools were not visually toggling when clicked despite state changes
   - Selected tools weren't being correctly communicated to the server
   - Mock GitHub tools were appearing instead of real MCP tools

2. **Server-Side Tool Processing Issues**:
   - Selected tools weren't being properly extracted from request body
   - The server wasn't including MCP tools that were selected but not already in combinedTools
   - Settings repository imports had issues with ESM/CJS compatibility

3. **Tools Configuration Page Issues**:
   - The settings page wasn't showing MCP tools for selection
   - Refresh functionality wasn't working properly in browser environment
   - New MCP tools weren't automatically enabled

## Implementation Details

### 1. Tool Selection Component Fixes

**Fixed State Management:**
- Replaced `localSelectedToolIds` with `internalSelection` using more reliable state management
- Added `forceRender` state to trigger explicit re-renders
- Enhanced the toggle mechanism with functional state updates
- Added a small delay after tool refresh to ensure tools are ready

**API Communication Improvements:**
- Improved the format of API requests to include selected tools in all necessary locations
- Enhanced error handling for tool refresh operations
- Added better visual feedback for tool selection state

### 2. Server-Side Tool Processing Enhancements

**Improved Tool Selection Handling:**
- Fixed extraction of selected tool IDs from various parts of the request body
- Added direct access to raw MCP tools when a selected tool isn't already in combinedTools
- Wrapped raw MCP tools with proper error handling

**Settings Repository Integration:**
- Improved ESM/CJS compatibility issues with better fallbacks
- Auto-enabled newly discovered MCP tools to ensure they're available
- Enhanced error handling with better fallback mechanisms

**Tool Refresh Functionality:**
- Enhanced the refresh endpoint to first reinitialize all clients
- Improved error handling and logging for refresh operations
- Added proper response formatting with tool counts and details

### 3. Tools Configuration Page Improvements

**API-Based Tool Fetching:**
- Changed to use API endpoints instead of direct MCP client access
- Implemented proper refresh mechanism that works in browser
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback

**UI Enhancements:**
- Improved display of available MCP tools
- Better grouping by provider
- More informative success/error messages

## Code Changes

### Key Files Modified:

1. `/apps/coder/src/components/ui/tool-select.tsx`
   - Fixed state management and toggle mechanism
   - Enhanced refresh functionality
   - Improved UI feedback

2. `/apps/coder/src/server/routes/chat.ts`
   - Enhanced tool extraction from requests
   - Improved settings repository integration
   - Added direct MCP tool access 

3. `/apps/coder/src/server/routes/mcp.ts`
   - Enhanced tool refresh endpoint
   - Improved error handling and logging

4. `/apps/coder/src/pages/settings/ToolsPage.tsx`
   - Changed to use API endpoints
   - Improved refresh mechanism
   - Enhanced UI feedback

## Benefits

1. **Reliability**: More reliable tool selection and toggling behavior
2. **Completeness**: All MCP tools properly appear in UI and can be enabled/disabled
3. **Consistency**: Tools selected in UI are correctly passed to API and included in chat
4. **Discoverability**: New tools from MCP servers are automatically enabled and available
5. **Error Handling**: Better error handling and user feedback throughout

## Usage

1. **Tool Selection in Chat**:
   - Click on the tool selection dropdown in the chat input area
   - Toggle tools on/off as needed
   - Selected tools will be passed to the AI in the next message

2. **Tool Configuration**:
   - Navigate to Settings â†’ Tools
   - All available MCP tools will be displayed, grouped by provider
   - Toggle tools on/off to enable/disable them globally
   - Use the "Refresh MCP Tools" button to discover new tools

## Future Improvements

1. Consider adding tool capabilities information from MCP server to better match tools to models
2. Improve caching of MCP tools to reduce server load
3. Add more detailed error reporting for tool execution failures
4. Consider adding tool usage analytics
