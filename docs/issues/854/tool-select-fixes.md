# Tool Selection UI Fixes

## Problem Description

The tool selection component had two significant issues:

1. **Missing Checkbox Toggling Functionality**: When clicking on tools like "shell_command", the selection was registered in the state (visible in console logs) but the checkbox wasn't visually updating in the UI.

2. **Sans-Serif Font**: The component was using sans-serif font instead of the monospace font that was previously used.

## Root Causes

1. **CommandItem Issues**: Using Radix UI CommandItem wasn't properly handling the toggle state updates
2. **Missing Visual Feedback**: There was no empty checkbox shown when a tool wasn't selected
3. **Font Class Removal**: The `font-mono` classes had been removed from the component

## Changes Made

### 1. Custom Tool Item Implementation

Replaced CommandItem with a custom div element that directly handles click events:

```tsx
<div
  key={tool.id}
  className="px-2 py-1.5 text-sm font-mono cursor-pointer hover:bg-muted/50 pl-9"
  onClick={(e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    e.stopPropagation();
    toggleTool(tool.id);
  }}
>
  {/* Content */}
</div>
```

### 2. Enhanced Visual Checkbox Implementation

Added a custom checkbox implementation with clearer state indication:

```tsx
<div 
  className="h-4 w-4 flex items-center justify-center border border-muted-foreground/40 rounded-sm"
  style={{ 
    backgroundColor: isSelected ? 'var(--primary)' : 'transparent',
    transition: 'background-color 0.15s ease-in-out'
  }}
>
  {isSelected && <Check className="h-3 w-3 text-white" />}
</div>
```

### 3. Improved Toggle Logic

Made the toggle function more robust with better state management:

```tsx
const toggleTool = (toolId: string) => {
  // Check current selection state
  const isCurrentlySelected = localSelectedToolIds.includes(toolId);
  
  // Create new selection based on current state
  let newSelection;
  if (isCurrentlySelected) {
    newSelection = localSelectedToolIds.filter(id => id !== toolId);
  } else {
    newSelection = [...localSelectedToolIds, toolId];
  }
  
  // Force a re-render by creating a new array reference
  setSelectedToolIds([...newSelection]); 
  onChange([...newSelection]);
};
```

### 4. Restored Monospace Font

Added `font-mono` class to all relevant elements in the component:

```tsx
// Examples of where font-mono was added:
<PopoverContent className="w-[350px] p-0 font-mono" align="start">
<Command className="font-mono">
<CommandInput placeholder="Search tools..." className="font-mono" />
<CommandList className="max-h-[350px] overflow-auto font-mono">
<span className="font-mono">{tool.name}</span>
<div className="text-xs text-muted-foreground pl-6 font-mono">
```

## Benefits

1. **Visual Feedback**: The checkbox now clearly shows when a tool is selected
2. **Reliable Toggling**: Clicking on tools now reliably toggles their selection state
3. **Consistent Styling**: The component now consistently uses monospace font
4. **Better UX**: Users can immediately see which tools are selected without confusion

## Testing Notes

The changes have been tested and verified to work with:
- Selecting and deselecting individual tools
- Visual feedback working correctly
- Monospace font applied consistently
- Proper parent component notifications when selections change
