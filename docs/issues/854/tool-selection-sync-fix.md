# Tool Selection Sync Fix

## Issue Summary

Tool selection in the UI wasn't properly synchronized with what was sent to the server. When a user deselected tools in the dropdown, the server would still receive and use the previously selected tools.

## Root Cause Analysis

After investigation, I found several issues:

1. **State Management Issues**: 
   - The component state (selectedToolIds) wasn't consistently synchronized between ChatInputArea and the child components
   - The dependency arrays in useMemo/useCallback hooks were missing the selectedToolIds dependency, preventing re-renders

2. **Props Passing Problems**:
   - The messageInputProps memo wasn't refreshing when the selectedToolIds changed
   - The renderMessageInput callback wasn't getting the latest tool selections

3. **Server Communication**:
   - The server was correctly implementing tool filtering but wasn't getting accurate tool selection data
   - The chat request wasn't properly including the most recent tool selection state

## Solution Implemented

1. **Enhanced State Management**:
   - Added session storage fallback for tool selections
   - Added more comprehensive logging throughout the selection process
   - Fixed all useMemo/useCallback dependency arrays to include selectedToolIds

2. **Improved Props Synchronization**:
   - Updated messageInputProps to properly depend on selectedToolIds
   - Enhanced renderMessageInput to log and react to tool selection changes

3. **Better Server Communication**:
   - Added robust null/undefined checks in the server's tool filtering
   - Enhanced server logging to show exactly which tools are included/excluded
   - Added defensive code to ensure selectedToolIds is always an array

4. **Debugging Enhancements**:
   - Added emojis and clear section markers in server logs
   - Enhanced client-side logging with more contextual information
   - Added tracking of excluded tools to help diagnose selection issues

## Verification

After these changes:
- Tool selection in the UI properly reflects in the request sent to the server
- Deselecting a tool removes it from the available tools in the chat completion
- Server logs clearly show which tools are being included based on user selection
- Chat responses only use the tools that are currently selected in the UI

Now when a tool is deselected, it will no longer be available to the model for that chat interaction.
