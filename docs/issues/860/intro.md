# Issue #860: Integrating MCP GitHub Tools into Coder Agent

## Understanding the Issue

The goal of issue #860 is to integrate the Model Context Protocol (MCP) GitHub tools with the existing Coder agent in the OpenAgents project. This will enable the Coder agent to perform GitHub operations through the MCP protocol.

### Key Components:

1. **Current Coder Agent**: 
   - Implemented in `packages/agents/src/server.ts`
   - Extends `AIChatAgent` from the agents package
   - Uses a tool system defined in `packages/agents/src/tools.ts`
   - Processes tool calls using utility functions in `packages/agents/src/utils.ts`

2. **MCP GitHub Server**:
   - External server that exposes GitHub operations as MCP tools
   - Not currently connected to the Coder agent
   - Provides a standard protocol for AI tools integration

3. **Current Limitations**:
   - No MCP client implementation in the codebase
   - No plugin architecture for extending agent capabilities
   - No integration with external tool providers like the MCP GitHub server

## Implementation Plan

1. **Research and Analysis** (Current Phase):
   - Understand the existing Coder agent architecture
   - Identify integration points for MCP client
   - Research the MCP protocol and GitHub tools interface

2. **MCP Client Implementation**:
   - Create a new MCP client module
   - Implement token management and authentication
   - Establish connection to MCP GitHub server

3. **Tool Integration**:
   - Map MCP GitHub tools to Coder's tool system
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Create a plugin architecture for tool registration

4. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Create unit tests for MCP client
   - Implement integration tests for GitHub operations
   - Add error scenario tests

5. **Documentation**:
   - Document the MCP integration
   - Provide examples for GitHub operations
   - Update relevant README files

## Technical Considerations

- **Security**: Ensure proper handling of GitHub tokens
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of MCP server connection failures
- **Performance**: Implement connection pooling for efficient operations
- **Rate Limiting**: Add request throttling to prevent API abuse
- **Timeouts**: Implement request timeouts for non-responsive operations

This implementation will significantly enhance the Coder agent's capabilities by enabling it to perform GitHub operations, making it more useful for software development tasks.
