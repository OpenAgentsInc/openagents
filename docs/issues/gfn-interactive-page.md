# Interactive GFN Formula Visualization Page

## Overview
Create an interactive web page at `/gfn` on openagents.com that allows users to explore and understand the Global Freedom Network (GFN) formula through interactive sliders and visualizations. The page should demonstrate how different network effects combine to create exponential value, with preset examples for OpenAI, Anthropic, and OpenAgents' projected growth.

## Background
The GFN formula combines three fundamental network effect laws:

**V_total = [α₁(k₁ × n) + α₂(k₂ × n²) + α₃(k₃ × 2ⁿ × C)] × Q × M × (1 + D)**

- **Sarnoff's Law** (linear): α₁(k₁ × n) - Broadcast value
- **Metcalfe's Law** (quadratic): α₂(k₂ × n²) - P2P connections  
- **Reed's Law** (exponential): α₃(k₃ × 2ⁿ × C) - Group-forming potential

## Requirements

### 1. Interactive Formula Controls
Create sliders for each variable with the following ranges:

**Core Variables:**
- **n** (Active Participants): 10 - 50,000,000 (log scale)
- **C** (Clustering Coefficient): 0.01 - 1.0 (linear)

**Network Type Coefficients (α):**
- **α₁** (Broadcast): 0.05 - 0.25
- **α₂** (P2P): 0.25 - 0.45
- **α₃** (Group): 0.30 - 0.80

**Value Per Connection (k):**
- **k₁**: $0.001 - $0.01
- **k₂**: $0.0005 - $0.003
- **k₃**: $0.00005 - $0.001

**Multipliers:**
- **Q** (Quality Factor): 0.5 - 3.0
- **M** (Platform Multiplier): 1.0 - 4.0
- **D** (Data Network Effect): 0.2 - 0.9

### 2. Preset Company Buttons
Implement buttons that instantly set all sliders to represent:

**OpenAI Button:**
- n = 100,000,000 (ChatGPT users)
- C = 0.05 (low group formation)
- α₁ = 0.15, α₂ = 0.45, α₃ = 0.40
- k₁ = $0.002, k₂ = $0.001, k₃ = $0.0001
- Q = 2.5, M = 2.0, D = 0.7

**Anthropic Button:**
- n = 10,000,000 (Claude users)
- C = 0.08 (slightly higher due to work focus)
- α₁ = 0.10, α₂ = 0.50, α₃ = 0.40
- k₁ = $0.003, k₂ = $0.0015, k₃ = $0.00015
- Q = 2.8, M = 1.8, D = 0.6

**OpenAgents Button:**
Should show multiple time projections:
- **Current (2024)**: n = 100, C = 0.6
- **6 months**: n = 10,000, C = 0.7
- **1 year**: n = 500,000, C = 0.8
- **2 years**: n = 10,000,000, C = 0.85
- **5 years**: n = 50,000,000, C = 0.9

With agent-optimized coefficients:
- α₁ = 0.05, α₂ = 0.25, α₃ = 0.70 (high group emphasis)
- k₁ = $0.005, k₂ = $0.002, k₃ = $0.0005
- Q = 3.0, M = 4.0, D = 0.9

### 3. Visualizations

#### Main Value Display
- Large, prominent display of **V_total** with dynamic formatting (K, M, B, T)
- Real-time updates as sliders move

#### Component Breakdown Chart
Stacked area or bar chart showing:
- Sarnoff contribution (α₁k₁n)
- Metcalfe contribution (α₂k₂n²)
- Reed contribution (α₃k₃2ⁿC)
- Multiplier effects (Q, M, D)

#### Growth Projection Chart
Line chart showing:
- Historical/current position
- Projected growth curves for different scenarios
- Comparison lines for OpenAI/Anthropic when selected

#### Network Effect Dominance Indicator
Visual showing which law dominates at current settings:
- Small n: Sarnoff dominates
- Medium n: Metcalfe dominates
- Large n + high C: Reed dominates

### 4. Educational Elements

#### Formula Explanation
Collapsible sections explaining:
- What each component represents
- Why AI agents enable true Reed's Law
- The exponential potential of agent coalitions

#### Insights Panel
Dynamic insights based on current settings:
- "At n=1000, Metcalfe's Law contributes 65% of value"
- "Increasing clustering coefficient by 0.1 adds $X million in value"
- "OpenAgents will surpass Anthropic's value at n=X agents"

### 5. UI/UX Requirements

#### Layout
- Clean, modern design using WebTUI components
- Responsive layout that works on desktop and mobile
- Dark mode by default with theme switcher

#### Interactivity
- Smooth, real-time updates without lag
- Tooltips on hover for all controls
- Number formatting with appropriate precision
- Log scale option for value display

#### Performance
- Efficient calculation to handle rapid slider movements
- Debounced updates for expensive visualizations
