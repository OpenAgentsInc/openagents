# Khala Code Desktop ↔ Mobile Tailnet Handshake

Status: live on `main`. Covers the connectivity status dot shipped in
`clients/khala-mobile` and the health beacon it talks to in
`clients/khala-code-desktop`.

## What this is

The mobile app (`clients/khala-mobile`, Expo/React Native) has a single home
screen: a red/green status dot showing whether it can currently see a running
Khala Code desktop instance. There is no login, pairing, or configuration step
— it just probes a fixed local port.

## Desktop side: the health beacon

`clients/khala-code-desktop/src/bun/index.ts` runs a second, minimal HTTP
server alongside the existing preview/RPC server:

- Bound to `0.0.0.0:50099` (not loopback-only) so it is reachable from other
  devices on the same network/Tailnet.
- Only route: `GET /health`, returns
  `{ ok: true, app: "Khala Code Desktop", hostname: os.hostname(), observedAt }`.
- Deliberately separate from the existing preview RPC server on a different
  port, which stays loopback-only because its `/rpc/*` routes carry a
  per-boot secret token. The health beacon carries no secret and exposes
  nothing but liveness + hostname, so widening its bind address is safe.
- Configurable via env: `KHALA_CODE_DESKTOP_TAILNET_HEALTH=0` disables it;
  `KHALA_CODE_DESKTOP_TAILNET_HEALTH_PORT` overrides the port. Both are typed
  entries in `khala-code-config.ts`'s `KhalaCodeEnvKey` union.
- Started once at boot via `startTailnetHealthBeacon()`, right after the
  existing `startPreviewServer()` call.

## Mobile side: the connectivity probe

Logic lives in `clients/khala-mobile/src/status/`, split into two files so the
pure resolution logic stays unit-testable under `bun test` (importing
`expo-device` pulls in React Native's Flow-syntax entry file, which breaks
Bun's plain JS/TS parser):

- `khala-code-connectivity-core.ts` — pure functions, no native imports.
  - `candidateTargets(isDevice, port, tailnetHosts)`: on a simulator, returns
    just `http://127.0.0.1:50099/health` (the simulator shares the host Mac's
    network stack, so localhost reaches whatever is running the desktop app
    on the same machine). On a physical device, returns one URL per
    configured Tailnet hostname (currently `imac-pro-bertha`,
    `macbook-pro-m2`) — edit `KHALA_CODE_TAILNET_CANDIDATE_HOSTS` to add more.
  - `resolveKhalaCodeConnectivity(targets, fetchImpl, timeoutMs)`: tries each
    candidate URL in order with a 1500ms per-host abort timeout, returns the
    first reachable one (`{ reachable, target, hostname, checkedAt }`), or an
    unreachable result if all fail.
- `khala-code-connectivity.ts` — thin wrapper: imports `expo-device` to detect
  `Device.isDevice`, and exposes `checkKhalaCodeConnectivity()` which calls the
  core resolver with real `fetch`.

`app/index.tsx` is the entire mobile home screen: it polls
`checkKhalaCodeConnectivity()` every 5 seconds and again whenever the app
returns to the foreground (`AppState` "active" transition), then renders a
colored dot (gray while checking, green if reachable, red otherwise) plus the
hostname and target URL it found.

## Simulator vs. device targeting

This is the one piece of routing logic in the handshake, and it is
intentional rather than a placeholder:

- **Simulator** (`Device.isDevice === false`): probe `127.0.0.1` only. The iOS
  Simulator shares the host Mac's loopback interface, so this is exactly the
  Khala Code desktop instance running on the same development machine — no
  Tailnet involved.
- **Physical device** (`Device.isDevice === true`): probe the configured
  Tailnet hostnames over the Tailnet, since a real phone is a separate network
  peer from the Mac running Khala Code desktop.

## Verification

Confirmed live in both states via the iOS Simulator: green dot + hostname when
a local `bun run dev` Khala Code desktop instance is up and the beacon
responds on `:50099`; red dot + "no khala code instance found" when the
desktop app (and thus the beacon) is not running.

## Chat streaming (added on top of this handshake)

See the "Chat streaming over Khala Sync" section below, added once a live
chat thread was wired through Khala Sync end-to-end and surfaced on the same
mobile home screen.
