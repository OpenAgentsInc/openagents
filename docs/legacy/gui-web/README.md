# Legacy Web GUI (Archived)

This directory contains the archived Actix/Maud/HTMX desktop webview stack that
previously lived under `src/gui/`. It is retained for historical reference only
and is not part of the active build.

Notes:
- The active desktop UI is WGPUI (`crates/wgpui`, `crates/autopilot`).
- Vera Mono font files remain at `src/gui/assets/fonts/` because WGPUI embeds
  them directly from that path.
