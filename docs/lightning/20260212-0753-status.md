# OpenAgents Bitcoin + Lightning Status Snapshot (2026-02-12)

Status: Implemented (buyer/L402), partially implemented (local-node + hosted seller infra)
Last reviewed: 2026-02-12
Scope: `packages/lightning-effect`, `packages/lnd-effect`, `apps/web`, `apps/autopilot-worker`, `apps/desktop`, `apps/lightning-ops`, `apps/mobile`

This document is a "what exists in code right now" snapshot, not a roadmap. Where something is only scaffolded, it is called out explicitly.

## 0) Summary

1. `@openagentsinc/lightning-effect` is the canonical Effect-first Lightning domain package. It implements the L402 buyer handshake (402 parse -> policy -> pay -> cache -> retry) and also contains typed seller/paywall contracts + deterministic seller test layers.
2. `@openagentsinc/lnd-effect` is the canonical Effect-first LND boundary package. It defines typed contracts/services and provides deterministic + REST transport layers.
3. `openagents.com` (`apps/web`) provides the Lightning "control plane":
   - Convex tables + mutations/queries for L402 tasks, paywalls, settlements, deployments, and events.
   - Worker HTTP APIs under `/api/lightning/*` that wrap those Convex operations with deterministic error taxonomy.
   - A typed Effect client (`LightningApiService`) used by UI/controllers to call the control plane.
   - UI panes that surface L402 attempts and hosted paywall state.
4. Autopilot (`apps/autopilot-worker`) exposes Lightning tools into the agent runtime:
   - `lightning_l402_fetch` creates a Lightning task in Convex and waits briefly for a terminal status.
   - `lightning_paywall_*` call the web control-plane HTTP endpoints (token gated) and return deterministic receipts.
5. The desktop app (`apps/desktop`) is the buyer-side payment executor boundary:
   - Main process bootstraps a real Spark wallet via Breez Spark SDK and can pay BOLT11 invoices with preimage extraction.
   - Main process also boots a local `lnd` Neutrino process (bundled binary, supervised with restart/backoff), but wallet/RPC/payment wiring to that running process is not yet complete.
   - Renderer runs an Effect-based executor loop that consumes Convex Lightning tasks and executes `fetchWithL402` using Spark when connected (else a deterministic LND fallback).
6. The mobile app (`apps/mobile`) currently has no Lightning/L402 wallet integration.

## 1) What Runs Where

| Component | Location | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L402 contracts + buyer logic | `packages/lightning-effect` | Parse `WWW-Authenticate: L402 ...`, enforce spend policy, pay invoice via adapter, cache credential, retry request | App-agnostic, intended to be reusable outside OpenAgents |
| LND contracts + transports | `packages/lnd-effect` | Typed LND boundary + deterministic and REST transport layers | App-agnostic, used by `lightning-effect` adapters and desktop fallback |
| Lightning control-plane data model | `apps/web/convex/lightning/*` | Tasks/paywalls/settlements/deployments/events schema + lifecycle enforcement | Source-of-truth state machine for L402 task execution |
| Lightning control-plane client | `apps/web/src/effect/lightning.ts` | Typed Effect client for tasks/paywalls/settlements/deployments | Mixes Convex queries with Worker HTTP APIs |
| Lightning HTTP API surface | `apps/web/src/effuse-host/lightning.ts` | `/api/lightning/*` routes for tasks + paywall ops, with deterministic error mapping | Used by desktop and paywall tools |
| Autopilot Lightning tools | `apps/autopilot-worker/src/tools.ts`, `apps/autopilot-worker/src/server.ts` | Expose `lightning_l402_fetch` + `lightning_paywall_*` to the agent runtime | `lightning_l402_fetch` does not execute payment in the Worker |
| Desktop executor boundary | `apps/desktop` | Owns wallet/payment execution and background task processing | Spark path is the real payment backend today |
| Hosted gateway ops | `apps/lightning-ops` | Deterministic Aperture config compiler + reconcile/smoke programs | Infrastructure wiring is not fully deployed yet |

## 2) Shared Packages

### 2.1 `packages/lightning-effect` (L402 + Lightning domain)

Package: `packages/lightning-effect/package.json`

Primary responsibilities:

1. Buyer-side L402 handshake in Effect: `packages/lightning-effect/src/l402/fetchWithL402.ts`
2. L402 contracts + schema decode/encode:
   - `packages/lightning-effect/src/contracts/l402.ts`
   - `packages/lightning-effect/src/contracts/payment.ts`
3. Buyer-side service tags:
   - `packages/lightning-effect/src/services/l402Client.ts`
   - `packages/lightning-effect/src/services/credentialCache.ts`
   - `packages/lightning-effect/src/services/invoicePayer.ts`
   - `packages/lightning-effect/src/services/spendPolicy.ts`
   - `packages/lightning-effect/src/services/l402Transport.ts`
4. Buyer adapters/layers:
   - Demo payer: `packages/lightning-effect/src/adapters/invoicePayerDemo.ts`
   - LND REST payer (direct): `packages/lightning-effect/src/adapters/invoicePayerLnd.ts`
   - Spark payer adapter: `packages/lightning-effect/src/adapters/invoicePayerSpark.ts`
   - `lnd-effect` bridge adapter: `packages/lightning-effect/src/lnd-effect/*`
5. Seller-side contracts and deterministic layers for hosted paywalls:
   - Contracts live under `packages/lightning-effect/src/contracts/seller/*` (via `src/contracts/index.ts`)
   - Service tags include `PaywallRegistryService`, `GatewayConfigCompilerService`, `InvoiceIssuerService`, `SettlementIngestService`, `SellerPolicyService` (see `packages/lightning-effect/README.md`)

Key implementation details of the buyer flow (`fetchWithL402`):

1. Host scoping is derived from the request URL via `new URL(url).host` (lowercased).
2. Cache key is `(host, scope)` where `scope` defaults to `"default"` (override via request `scope`).
3. If cache is hit, request is attempted with `Authorization: L402 ...`.
4. A `402` or `401` invalidates cached credentials and triggers challenge resolution.
5. The L402 challenge is parsed from `WWW-Authenticate` (case-insensitive header name).
6. Spend policy gates *before* paying:
   - `deps.policy.ensureRequestAllowed({ host, quotedAmountMsats, maxSpendMsats })`
7. Invoice is paid via `deps.payer.payInvoice({ invoice, maxAmountMsats, host })`.
8. The credential is cached and the request is retried with `Authorization: L402 macaroon="...", preimage="..."`.
9. A post-payment `402`/`401` invalidates the cached credential and fails with `CredentialMissingError`.

Important current limitation in OpenAgents usage:

1. `L402FetchResult` supports returning response body (`responseBody`), but current OpenAgents tool surfaces only status/proof metadata and does not return the premium payload to the agent (see Section 5.4 and Section 6.1).

Tests:

1. `packages/lightning-effect/test/*` covers challenge parsing, auth header serialization, spend policy gates, payer contracts, Spark integration, and seller contract determinism.
2. Run:
   - `cd packages/lightning-effect && npm run typecheck`
   - `cd packages/lightning-effect && npm test`

### 2.2 `packages/lnd-effect` (LND boundary)

Package: `packages/lnd-effect/package.json`

Primary responsibilities:

1. Define typed LND contracts (node info, balances, channels, wallet state): `packages/lnd-effect/src/contracts/lnd.ts`
2. Define RPC transport contracts and request/response schemas: `packages/lnd-effect/src/contracts/rpc.ts`
3. Provide deterministic adapters for tests and offline flows:
   - `packages/lnd-effect/src/adapters/lndNodeDeterministic.ts` exports `makeLndDeterministicLayer(...)`
4. Provide REST transport layer with typed auth/transport/decode errors:
   - `packages/lnd-effect/src/adapters/lndRestTransport.ts`
   - `packages/lnd-effect/src/layers/lndRestTransport.ts`

Current OpenAgents usage:

1. Desktop L402 executor includes an LND deterministic fallback payment backend via `makeLndDeterministicLayer()` (see Section 4.4).
2. `lightning-effect` can be wired to real LND via:
   - `packages/lightning-effect/src/adapters/invoicePayerLnd.ts` (direct REST)
   - `packages/lightning-effect/src/lnd-effect/*` (via `lnd-effect` services)

Tests:

1. `packages/lnd-effect/test/*` covers deterministic layers and transport error mapping.
2. Run:
   - `cd packages/lnd-effect && npm run typecheck`
   - `cd packages/lnd-effect && npm test`

## 3) L402 Buyer Flow (Protocol and Current Implementation)

### 3.1 Protocol shape

For an L402-protected endpoint, the server responds:

1. HTTP `402 Payment Required`
2. `WWW-Authenticate: L402 ...` containing:
   - `invoice="ln..."`
   - `macaroon="..."`
   - optional `amount_msats=...`

The client pays the invoice, obtains a preimage, and retries with:

1. `Authorization: L402 macaroon="<macaroon>", preimage="<preimage>"`

### 3.2 OpenAgents buyer execution (as implemented)

The current buyer execution path in OpenAgents is:

1. Autopilot creates a Convex Lightning task with L402 request details.
2. Desktop executor polls pending tasks for the signed-in user.
3. Desktop executor runs `fetchWithL402` with:
   - Live HTTP transport (`fetch`)
   - In-memory credential cache
   - Spend policy
   - Invoice payer: Spark (preferred) or deterministic LND fallback
4. Desktop writes task transitions and payment metadata back to the control plane.

## 4) Desktop App (`apps/desktop`)

Desktop is the execution boundary for wallet/payment operations. It is intentionally split into:

1. Main process: owns secrets, spawns `lnd`, manages Spark wallet, exposes restricted IPC APIs
2. Renderer: Effect runtime, UI panes, Convex task execution loop (no secret-bearing values)

### 4.1 Main process: LND runtime supervisor (Neutrino)

Core files:

1. Runtime manager: `apps/desktop/src/main/lndRuntimeManager.ts`
2. Config builder: `apps/desktop/src/main/lndRuntimeConfig.ts`
3. Bundled binary resolver: `apps/desktop/src/main/lndBinaryResolver.ts`
4. Process transport: `apps/desktop/src/main/lndProcessTransport.ts`

Binary shipping model:

1. Pinned release manifest: `apps/desktop/lnd/lnd-artifacts.json` (currently `v0.20.0-beta`)
2. Prepare script downloads + verifies archive and binary checksums:
   - `apps/desktop/scripts/prepare-lnd-binaries.mjs`
   - Stages under `apps/desktop/build-resources/lnd/<target>/`
   - Writes `apps/desktop/build-resources/lnd/runtime-manifest.json`
3. Packaged apps load the binary from `process.resourcesPath/lnd/...`
4. Dev builds load from `apps/desktop/build-resources/lnd/...`
5. Optional local override for a dev-built binary:
   - `OA_DESKTOP_LND_DEV_BINARY_PATH=/Users/christopherdavid/code/lnd/lnd`
   - Optional `OA_DESKTOP_LND_DEV_BINARY_SHA256=<sha256>` to enforce integrity

Default Neutrino runtime config (dev defaults, override via env):

1. Network: `testnet`
2. RPC listen: `127.0.0.1:10009`
3. REST listen: `127.0.0.1:8080`
4. P2P listen: `127.0.0.1:19735` (chosen to avoid common `9735` conflicts)
5. Config path: `${userData}/lnd/<network>/config/lnd.conf`
6. Data/log dirs: `${userData}/lnd/<network>/{data,logs}`

Health + sync observation:

1. The runtime manager attempts a REST `GET /v1/getinfo` probe.
2. It requires:
   - TLS cert at `${configDir}/tls.cert`
   - `admin.macaroon` at `${runtimeDir}/data/chain/bitcoin/<network>/admin.macaroon`
3. If `admin.macaroon` is not present, the runtime reports `admin_macaroon_unavailable` and sync fields remain null.

Important current limitation:

1. The desktop app does not yet wire the wallet unlock/init path to the *real* LND process RPC. Until that exists, `admin.macaroon` availability and REST probing will not become "fully healthy" in a fresh install without manual wallet initialization.

### 4.2 Main process: Spark wallet (Breez Spark SDK) with NIP-06 mnemonic

Core files:

1. Spark manager: `apps/desktop/src/main/sparkWalletManager.ts`
2. IPC channels: `apps/desktop/src/main/sparkWalletIpc.ts`
3. Secure storage: `apps/desktop/src/main/desktopSecureStorage.ts`

Key behaviors:

1. Uses `nostr-effect` NIP-06 helpers:
   - `generateSeedWords()` for mnemonic generation
   - `validateWords()` for mnemonic validation
2. Stores mnemonic in OS-provided encryption via Electron `safeStorage` (never exposed to renderer):
   - storage key: `spark.wallet.mnemonic`
3. Connects Spark via `@breeztech/breez-sdk-spark/nodejs` using `SdkBuilder` and a persistent storage dir:
   - default: `${userData}/spark`
4. Pays BOLT11 invoices:
   - Calls `prepareSendPayment`
   - Calls `sendPayment`
   - Extracts lightning preimage from `payment.details` when `type === "lightning"`
   - Returns `InvoicePaymentResult` with `preimageHex` required for L402 auth

Spark env configuration:

1. `OA_DESKTOP_SPARK_NETWORK`: `mainnet` or `regtest` (default `regtest`)
2. `OA_DESKTOP_SPARK_API_KEY` or `OA_DESKTOP_BREEZ_API_KEY`: required for real network usage
3. `OA_DESKTOP_SPARK_MNEMONIC_PASSPHRASE`: optional
4. `OA_DESKTOP_SPARK_AUTO_GENERATE_MNEMONIC`: set to `0` to disable auto-generation
5. `OA_DESKTOP_SPARK_PAYMENT_TIMEOUT_SECS`: default `45` (bounded)

### 4.3 Main process: Wallet manager (current state)

Core files:

1. Wallet manager: `apps/desktop/src/main/lndWalletManager.ts`
2. Local wallet state service: `apps/desktop/src/main/lndWalletLocalService.ts`

Current behavior:

1. Wallet lifecycle state is persisted locally and deterministically (JSON file under `${userData}/lnd/wallet/wallet-state.json`).
2. This is a scaffolding layer to support UI + control-plane wiring without depending on real LND wallet RPC being present.
3. This does not yet unlock/create the *real* LND wallet inside the running `lnd` process.

### 4.4 Renderer: L402 executor + task loop

Core files:

1. L402 executor: `apps/desktop/src/effect/l402Executor.ts`
2. Executor loop: `apps/desktop/src/effect/executorLoop.ts`
3. Task provider transport: `apps/desktop/src/effect/taskProvider.ts`
4. Spark renderer gateway: `apps/desktop/src/effect/sparkWalletGateway.ts`
5. Desktop runtime model: `apps/desktop/src/effect/model.ts`

Backend selection:

1. If Spark wallet lifecycle is `connected`, invoice payer is Spark.
2. Otherwise invoice payer is deterministic LND (via `makeLndDeterministicLayer()`), and `paymentBackend` is recorded as `lnd_deterministic`.

Task control-plane interaction:

1. Desktop authenticates as the same user as `openagents.com` via the magic-code flow.
2. Desktop stores the session token in memory and uses it as `Authorization: Bearer ...` against web Worker APIs:
   - `POST /api/lightning/l402/tasks/:taskId/transition`
   - `GET /api/lightning/l402/tasks?...`
3. Desktop loops every `OA_DESKTOP_EXECUTOR_TICK_MS` (default 2000ms) and:
   - polls for a pending task
   - transitions `queued/approved -> running`
   - executes L402 fetch/payment
   - transitions to `paid` or `cached`, then `completed` (or `blocked`/`failed`)

Important current limitation:

1. Desktop does not persist the L402 credential cache across restarts (it is `CredentialCacheInMemoryLayer`).
2. Desktop does not currently write premium response bodies into Convex task results or tool output, even though `fetchWithL402` can read them.

### 4.5 UI panes (Effuse panes)

Renderer is Effuse-based and uses the pane system (shared lineage with `apps/web`):

1. Pane mounting: `apps/desktop/src/renderer.ts` uses `@openagentsinc/effuse-panes`
2. Pane models: `apps/desktop/src/effect/paneModels.ts`
3. Layout/specs: `apps/desktop/src/effect/paneLayout.ts`

Desktop currently surfaces:

1. Node runtime status and logs (LND supervisor)
2. Wallet lifecycle scaffolding state
3. Spark wallet lifecycle/balance/errors
4. Executor queue status and failure classification

### 4.6 Desktop verification commands

From `apps/desktop/package.json`:

1. `cd apps/desktop && npm run typecheck`
2. `cd apps/desktop && npm run lint`
3. `cd apps/desktop && npm test`
4. LND binary prep and smokes:
   - `cd apps/desktop && npm run lnd:prepare`
   - `cd apps/desktop && npm run smoke:lnd-binary -- --json`
   - `cd apps/desktop && npm run smoke:lnd-runtime -- --json`
   - `cd apps/desktop && npm run smoke:lnd-runtime-real -- --json` (opt-in real binary test)

## 5) Web App (`apps/web`) Control Plane + UI

### 5.1 Convex Lightning data model

Convex modules (source-of-truth lifecycle):

1. L402 tasks: `apps/web/convex/lightning/tasks.ts`
2. Hosted paywalls: `apps/web/convex/lightning/paywalls.ts`
3. Settlements: `apps/web/convex/lightning/settlements.ts`
4. Ops/deployments: `apps/web/convex/lightning/ops.ts`
5. Security gates: `apps/web/convex/lightning/security.ts`

Tasks state machine (current statuses):

1. `queued`
2. `approved`
3. `running`
4. `paid`
5. `cached`
6. `blocked`
7. `failed`
8. `completed`

### 5.2 Worker HTTP APIs

Worker handler: `apps/web/src/effuse-host/lightning.ts`

This file implements deterministic JSON APIs under `/api/lightning/*` and normalizes:

1. input shape via Effect `Schema`
2. error taxonomy into stable HTTP status codes
3. request correlation via `x-oa-request-id`

Control-plane endpoints used today (not exhaustive):

1. L402 tasks:
   - `POST /api/lightning/l402/tasks` (create task)
   - `GET /api/lightning/l402/tasks?status=&limit=` (list tasks)
   - `POST /api/lightning/l402/tasks/:taskId/transition` (transition task)
2. Hosted paywalls:
   - `GET /api/lightning/paywalls?status=&limit=`
   - `GET /api/lightning/paywalls/:paywallId`
   - `POST /api/lightning/paywalls` (create)
   - `PATCH /api/lightning/paywalls/:paywallId` (update)
   - `POST /api/lightning/paywalls/:paywallId/pause`
   - `POST /api/lightning/paywalls/:paywallId/resume`
3. Settlements and deployments:
   - `GET /api/lightning/settlements`
   - `GET /api/lightning/paywalls/:paywallId/settlements`
   - `GET /api/lightning/deployments`
   - `GET /api/lightning/deployments/events`

These endpoints are consumed by:

1. Desktop app (Bearer token, user-scoped)
2. Autopilot paywall tool control plane (token-scoped, see Section 6.2)

### 5.3 UI: L402 panes

Pane wiring is in the Effuse controller layer:

1. Pane controller: `apps/web/src/effuse-app/controllers/home/openChatPaneController.ts`
2. L402 payment metadata extraction: `apps/web/src/effuse-app/controllers/autopilotChatParts.ts`

Pane IDs currently used:

1. `l402-wallet` (wallet summary derived from recent L402 attempts)
2. `l402-transactions` (recent L402 attempts)
3. `l402-paywalls` (hosted paywall list)
4. `l402-settlements` (settlement list)
5. `l402-deployments` (deployment + events list)
6. Per-payment detail panes opened dynamically from transaction rows

Important nuance:

1. The "wallet" and "transactions" panes are projections of *tool/task metadata* (attempts, statuses, amounts), not a direct on-chain/node wallet balance.

### 5.4 Autopilot integration in web host

Tool execution wiring (web host side):

1. Autopilot host: `apps/web/src/effuse-host/autopilot.ts`
2. Tool name: `lightning_l402_fetch`
3. The host code creates a task in Convex and waits briefly for terminal status, returning only:
   - status (`completed|cached|blocked|failed`)
   - proofReference (if available)
   - paymentId / amountMsats (if available)
   - responseStatusCode (if available)

Current limitation:

1. The tool does not return the premium response payload to the model, even if it was fetched during task execution.

## 6) Autopilot Worker (`apps/autopilot-worker`)

### 6.1 `lightning_l402_fetch` tool

Contracts: `apps/autopilot-worker/src/tools.ts`
Implementation: `apps/autopilot-worker/src/server.ts`

Behavior:

1. Validates tool input with Effect `Schema`.
2. Creates a Lightning task in Convex (`api.lightning.tasks.createTask`) with deterministic idempotency key.
3. Waits for up to ~4.5 seconds for the task to reach a terminal status (polling Convex).
4. If it times out, it transitions the task to `blocked` with `desktop_executor_timeout`.
5. Returns a terminal result summary only (no payload body).

This tool explicitly does not execute wallet payments inside the Worker.

### 6.2 Hosted paywall tools (`lightning_paywall_*`)

Contracts: `apps/autopilot-worker/src/tools.ts`
HTTP control plane executor: `apps/autopilot-worker/src/lightningPaywallControlPlane.ts`

Behavior:

1. Reads control plane config from Worker env:
   - `OA_LIGHTNING_CONTROL_PLANE_BASE_URL`
   - `OA_LIGHTNING_CONTROL_PLANE_AUTH_TOKEN`
2. Calls the corresponding `apps/web` Worker endpoint (`/api/lightning/paywalls`, etc.).
3. Returns deterministic receipts with:
   - params_hash
   - output_hash
   - latency_ms
   - structured side effects

## 7) Hosted Seller Stack (Current Implementation Status)

Implemented in code (scaffolding + deterministic pieces):

1. Seller/paywall contracts and services in `packages/lightning-effect` (see `packages/lightning-effect/README.md`).
2. Convex control-plane for paywalls/settlements/deployments in `apps/web/convex/lightning/*`.
3. Worker HTTP API routes for paywall CRUD and listings in `apps/web/src/effuse-host/lightning.ts`.
4. `apps/lightning-ops`:
   - Deterministic Aperture config compiler (`aperture.yaml` + stable `configHash`)
   - Reconcile skeletons for staging workflows
   - Smoke programs for observability correlation

Not yet implemented in production:

1. A deployed Aperture gateway runtime that serves real L402-protected routes for OpenAgents-hosted paywalls.
2. Settlement ingestion from a real node into Convex settlement records.
3. Key isolation (remote signer) and macaroon bakery flows for hosted infrastructure.

## 8) `apps/lightning-ops` (Hosted gateway operations)

Entry point:

1. `apps/lightning-ops/src/main.ts`

Core responsibilities today:

1. Compile deterministic gateway config (Aperture yaml) from paywall definitions.
2. Provide reconcile/smoke programs that validate:
   - determinism of compilation
   - control-plane compatibility
   - observability record completeness

Verification:

1. `cd apps/lightning-ops && npm run typecheck`
2. `cd apps/lightning-ops && npm test`
3. `cd apps/lightning-ops && npm run smoke:full-flow`

## 9) Mobile (`apps/mobile`)

Current status:

1. No Lightning wallet, Spark, LND, or L402 execution is implemented in the React Native app yet.
2. Mobile remains an Autopilot product surface and Convex client; Lightning is currently executed via desktop + web control plane.

## 10) Known Gaps (Current)

These are gaps in *current implementation*, not "ideas":

1. Real LND wallet lifecycle and macaroon/TLS readiness are not wired end-to-end (desktop wallet manager is local-state scaffolding).
2. Desktop L402 executor does not use the real local `lnd` process as a payment backend yet.
3. L402 paid fetches do not currently return the premium response payload to the model/tool output, even though `fetchWithL402` can read it.
4. L402 credential cache is in-memory only in the desktop executor today.
5. Hosted paywall contracts/control-plane exist, but there is no deployed Aperture gateway runtime yet.
