# Liquid Glass — Notes and Structure

Unofficial working notes for the new Apple design system centered on Liquid Glass. This folder organizes takeaways from the session transcript (“Get to know the new design system”) by Maria from the Apple Design Team. Use these as a starting point for design reviews and implementation guides.

> Source: session transcript summarized here; consult Apple’s official HIG and documentation for authoritative guidance.

## What’s inside

- visual-design.md — color, type, shapes, concentricity, control sizes
- structure-and-navigation.md — functional layer, bars, tabs, scroll edge effects, sidebars
- continuity-and-components.md — cross‑device continuity, symbols/labels, menus, component anatomy/behavior
- adoption-checklist.md — practical steps for designers and engineers
 - apis-and-implementation.md — SwiftUI/UIKit APIs (glassEffect, GlassEffectContainer, UIGlassEffect), availability, fallbacks, and tips

## Big ideas (at a glance)

- A harmonized language: Liquid Glass reshapes the interface↔content relationship with new heuristics, making the system more cohesive, adaptive, and expressive across platforms.
- Concentric geometry: Fixed, capsule, and concentric shapes create rhythm and visual balance, aligning UI with hardware curvature and margins.
- Structure with focus: A functional layer floats above content, clarifying hierarchy, anchoring interactions to their source, and keeping focus grounded.
- Continuity: Shared anatomy and behaviors let designs scale across iPhone, iPad, and Mac without “starting over”.
