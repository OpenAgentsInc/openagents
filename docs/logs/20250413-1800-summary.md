**Project Context Document for OpenAgents Coder Agent Development**

**1. Overall Goal:**

The primary objective is to develop a sophisticated `Coder` agent capable of interacting with GitHub repositories, understanding codebase structure, managing tasks, and potentially performing autonomous actions over extended periods (continuous run / overnight execution). The agent uses the Vercel AI SDK, leverages Cloudflare Workers with Durable Objects (via the `agents`/`partyserver` base class) for state persistence and scheduling, and interacts with LLMs via OpenRouter.

**2. Core Architecture & Components:**

*   **Backend:** `packages/agents/src/server.ts` defines the `Coder` class, extending a base `Agent` class (likely built on Cloudflare Durable Objects).
*   **Frontend:** A React frontend (likely `apps/website/app/routes/agent/$agentId.tsx` or similar) uses the `agents/react` `useAgent` hook for WebSocket communication and state synchronization.
*   **State Management:** Relies on the `CoderState` interface (`packages/agents/src/types.ts`) and the `this.setState` method provided by the base `Agent` class, augmented by direct use of `this.ctx.storage.put` for reliability.
*   **AI Interaction:**
    *   Uses `generateText` for primary conversational responses and tool selection.
    *   Uses `generateObject` with Zod schemas for structured data generation (planning thoughts, file summaries, task definitions).
    *   Models: Primarily `google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25` (`model`), with `openai/gpt-4o-mini` (`smallModel`) used for `generateObject` calls.
*   **Tools:** Defined in `packages/agents/src/tools.ts` using the `ai` SDK's `tool` function. Includes GitHub interactions (`get_file_contents`, `add_issue_comment` - implementations likely in `@openagents/core`), scheduling (`scheduleTask`, `listSystemSchedules`, `deleteSystemSchedule`), task listing (`listAgentTasks`), context setting (`set_repository_context`), and basic utilities.
*   **Scheduling:** Uses the base `Agent` class's `this.schedule()` method (likely wrapping Durable Object alarms) for time-delayed or cron-based execution of agent methods.
*   **Context Propagation:** Originally used `AsyncLocalStorage` (`agentContext`) to allow tools access to the agent instance, crucial for tools needing to call agent methods like `schedule` or access state.

**3. Agent State (`CoderState` in `types.ts`):**

```typescript
// packages/agents/src/types.ts
import { type UIMessage } from "ai";

export interface CoderState {
  messages: UIMessage[];
  githubToken?: string;
  currentRepoOwner?: string;
  currentRepoName?: string;
  currentBranch?: string;
  codebase?: CodebaseState;
  scratchpad?: string; // AI-generated planning/thoughts
  tasks?: Task[]; // Agent's internal task list
  observations?: string[]; // Log of agent actions/tool results
  workingFilePath?: string; // Currently focused file
  isContinuousRunActive?: boolean; // Flag for background loop
}

export interface CodebaseState {
  structure?: Record<string, FileNode>; // Map of paths to file/dir info
  // dependencies?: Record<string, string>; // Initially planned, less used now
  // modules?: Record<string, ModuleDescription>; // Initially planned, less used now
}

export interface FileNode {
  type: 'file' | 'directory';
  path: string;
  description?: string; // AI-generated summary or 'Accessed at...'
  tags?: string[]; // AI-generated tags
  metadata?: {
    exports?: string[];
    dependencies?: string[];
    complexity?: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
    lastAnalyzed?: string; // Timestamp of last AI summary
    [key: string]: any;
  };
  // children?: string[]; // Removed/unused - structure is flat map
}

export interface Task {
  id: string;
  description: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'in-progress' | 'completed' | 'failed' | 'cancelled';
  created: Date;
  updated?: Date;
  completed?: Date;
  notes?: string[];
  scheduleId?: string; // Link to system schedule
  payload?: Record<string, any>; // Data for scheduled callback
  callbackMethodName?: string; // Method to call for schedule
}
```

**4. Key Functionality & Logic Flow:**

*   **`infer()` Method:** The main entry point for processing user messages or internal triggers.
    *   Retrieves current state (`messages`, `githubToken`, etc.).
    *   Generates a `systemPrompt` using `getSystemPrompt(this.state)` which includes serialized state info (repo context, scratchpad, codebase summary, tasks, observations).
    *   Handles **Intent Detection** for specific user commands (`start/stop continuous run`, `set repo context`) *before* calling the main LLM.
    *   Calls `generateText` with messages, system prompt, and tools.
    *   Processes the `result` from `generateText`:
        *   Updates observations.
        *   Checks for Task Generation based on user message (if no command intent detected).
        *   Consolidates `toolCalls` and `toolResults` from the `result.steps` array.
        *   Processes consolidated tool results (e.g., calling `updateCodebaseStructure` for `get_file_contents`).
        *   Updates the `scratchpad`.
        *   Updates the `messages` state with the final assistant response (text + tool parts).
*   **Continuous Run (`continueInfer`, `planNext...`, `scheduled...` methods):**
    *   Activated/Deactivated by `startContinuousRun`/`stopContinuousRun` methods (callable via WebSocket command).
    *   `continueInfer` runs on a schedule (default 120s).
    *   `continueInfer` calls `planNextExplorationStep` to decide the *next single action* (e.g., list dir `/`, summarize `README.md`).
    *   `planNextExplorationStep` uses current `codebase` state to make decisions (prioritizes root, important dirs, unsummarized files). It returns `null` if repo context is missing (triggering `stopContinuousRun`) or if no clear next step is found.
    *   `continueInfer` schedules the *specific action method* (`scheduledListFiles` or `scheduledSummarizeFile`) with necessary payload (path, owner, repo) to run after a short delay (5s).
    *   `continueInfer` reschedules *itself* for the next planning cycle if an action was planned and the run is still active.
    *   `scheduledListFiles`/`scheduledSummarizeFile` execute *only* their specific task:
        *   Call helper methods (`fetchDirectoryContents`/`fetchFileContent`) for direct GitHub API interaction (using persisted `githubToken`).
        *   Update state via `updateCodebaseStructure` (which calls `generateObject` with `smallModel` for summaries).
        *   They **do not** call `infer()`.
*   **State Update (`updateState`):** Central method to update state. **Crucially, the most recent instructions were to modify this to use `this.ctx.storage.put('coderState', newState)` in addition to `this.setState(newState)` to ensure persistence.**
*   **State Hydration (`ensureStateLoaded`):** A helper method added to be called at the start of scheduled/command methods to attempt forcing state load from storage due to observed inconsistencies. **The last instructions involved implementing this using `this.ctx.storage.get('coderState')` or a fallback.**

**5. Development History & Debugging Journey:**

*   Initial setup involved basic chat and tools.
*   Added state (`CoderState`) for context (messages, repo info, etc.).
*   Introduced `AsyncLocalStorage` (`agentContext`) for tool access to agent instance.
*   Implemented `generateObject` with Zod schemas (`PlanningSchema`, `FileSummarySchema`, `NewTaskSchema`) to enrich state (`scratchpad`, `codebase`, `tasks`).
*   Refactored scheduling tools (`scheduleTask`, etc.) for flexibility (callback method, payload) and integration with internal `tasks` state.
*   Implemented continuous run feature (`continueInfer`, `start/stop` methods).
*   **Debugging 1 (Timeouts):** Encountered `blockConcurrencyWhile` errors because `continueInfer` called the full `infer` method, taking too long. **Fix:** Refactored `continueInfer` into the Plan -> Schedule Action -> Reschedule Planner loop, creating lightweight `scheduledListFiles`/`scheduledSummarizeFile` methods with direct GitHub API calls.
*   **Debugging 2 (Tool Reporting):** Found `generateText` wasn't reliably populating top-level `result.toolCalls`/`toolResults`. **Fix:** Switched to processing the `result.steps` array and consolidating tool info using `toolInfoMap`.
*   **Debugging 3 (Base64):** Encountered `atob`/`Buffer` decoding errors. **Fix:** Correctly extracted nested `.content` property from GitHub API result object and used robust decoding (`Buffer.from`/`TextDecoder`).
*   **Debugging 4 (UI Duplication/Order):** Tool cards appeared incorrectly. **Fix:** Modified `infer`'s tool processing loop to add only the final `result` state part to `messageParts` for display.
*   **Debugging 5 (Intent Handling):** Agent didn't reliably use `set_repository_context` tool or start continuous run from prompts. **Fix:** Added stronger system prompt guidance (#10). Added explicit intent detection within `infer` to directly call `startContinuousRun` (and then `return {}`) or guide the LLM for `set_repository_context`. Prevented task generation when command intent was detected.
*   **Debugging 6 (State Persistence/Rehydration - CURRENT FOCUS):** Observed that repo context set in one turn was `undefined` when the agent woke up for the next message or scheduled task. The `ensureStateLoaded` attempt using dummy reads/writes was insufficient.

**6. Current Problem:**

The primary remaining blocker is the **State Rehydration Failure**. State updated via `this.setState` (e.g., `currentRepoOwner`) is not reliably available when the Durable Object wakes up later for a new message or a scheduled alarm (`continueInfer`, `scheduledListFiles`, etc.), even though the update seemed successful within the turn it happened.

**7. Last Proposed Solution / Next Task for New Agent:**

The last instruction set focused on directly interacting with the Durable Object storage API to fix the persistence issue:

1.  **Store `ctx`:** Add `private ctx: DurableObjectState;` property to `Coder` and initialize `this.ctx = ctx;` in the constructor.
2.  **Use `storage.put`:** Modify the `private async updateState(partialState: Partial<CoderState>)` method. After calculating `newState` and calling `this.setState(newState)`, add `await this.ctx.storage.put('coderState', newState);` to explicitly persist the *entire* state object to DO storage under a known key (e.g., 'coderState'). Make `updateState` async and add `await` to all its call sites.
3.  **Explicit State Read (If Needed):** Decide whether to keep/improve `ensureStateLoaded` to use `await this.ctx.storage.get<CoderState>('coderState')` at the start of critical methods, OR remove `ensureStateLoaded` entirely and rely on the explicit `put` in `updateState` plus the platform's default hydration being sufficient now. **Start by removing `ensureStateLoaded` and its calls.**
4.  **Refine `onMessage`:** Ensure `onMessage` only calls `infer` when necessary (e.g., for user messages needing processing, not simple token updates or commands). Ensure `await this.ensureStateLoaded()` (or the explicit read logic) is called *before* processing commands if `ensureStateLoaded` is kept. *(Self-correction: Based on removing `ensureStateLoaded`, this explicit call in `onMessage` would also be removed initially).*
5.  **Security Check:** Remove any remaining `console.log`s outputting the GitHub token.

**Your immediate task is to implement steps 1, 2, and 3 (Option B - remove `ensureStateLoaded`) from the proposed solution above.** You also need to perform the security check (Step 5) first.

**8. Testing Plan (After Implementation):**

1.  Set context using the `set_repository_context` tool message. Verify state update.
2.  Start continuous run using the "Start a continuous run..." message. Verify `isContinuousRunActive` becomes true and `infer` returns early.
3.  Observe logs for the first `continueInfer` cycle. **Crucially, check the `[continueInfer ENTRY]` log – does it now show the correct Owner/Repo loaded from the persisted state?**
4.  Observe logs for the first `scheduledListFiles`. Check its entry log for correct state. Verify it runs correctly.
5.  Observe logs for the second `continueInfer` cycle. Check its entry log for correct state. Verify it plans the next step.
6.  Observe logs for the second action (`scheduledSummarizeFile`). Check its entry log for correct state. Verify it runs and updates the codebase state with a good summary.
7.  Test stopping the run via the button/command.
