Okay, let's comment on the agent's work based on the diffs and the final code provided.

**Overall Assessment:**

Excellent work! The agent correctly understood and implemented the requested refactoring based on the previous feedback. It successfully separated concerns, moved type definitions, implemented state management within the `Coder` class, and integrated the new state into the prompt generation and agent lifecycle.

**Specific Comments:**

1.  **File Separation (`types.ts`, `prompts.ts`, `server.ts`):**
    *   **`types.ts`:** Perfect. It correctly centralizes all the state-related type definitions (`CoderState`, `Task`, `FileNode`, etc.). This significantly improves organization and maintainability.
    *   **`prompts.ts`:**
        *   **Good:** Correctly imports types from `types.ts`.
        *   **Good:** Simplified `SystemPromptOptions` to correctly take `state: CoderState` as the primary input.
        *   **Good:** Removed the state helper functions (`updateScratchpad`, etc.). The responsibility for state mutation is now correctly outside this file.
        *   **Good:** The `getSystemPrompt` function correctly destructures the necessary properties from the passed `state` object.
        *   **Minor Issue (Based on Agent's Diff Description vs. Final Code):** The agent's diff description mentioned removing the `AsyncLocalStorage` import and `agentContext` definition. However, looking at the final `prompts.ts` code provided *after* the diff, these lines (`import { AsyncLocalStorage }...` and `export const agentContext = ...`) are **not** present. **This is the correct outcome.** It seems the agent might have misreported the diff slightly, but the final resulting code is correct in that `agentContext` is *not* defined here. This file is now purely focused on prompt generation.
    *   **`server.ts`:**
        *   **Excellent:** Correctly imports types from `types.ts` and `getSystemPrompt` from `prompts.ts`.
        *   **Excellent:** `initialState` is properly updated to include all the new state fields (`codebase`, `scratchpad`, etc.) with appropriate default values.
        *   **Excellent:** Implemented private helper methods (`addAgentTask`, `updateTaskStatus`, `updateAgentScratchpad`, `addAgentObservation`, `updateCodebaseStructure`, `setCurrentFile`) directly within the `Coder` class. This is the correct place for state mutation logic.
        *   **Excellent:** All these private methods correctly use `this.setState({ ...this.state, ... })` for immutable state updates.
        *   **Excellent:** The `infer` method now correctly calls `getSystemPrompt` with the current agent state.
        *   **Excellent:** Integrated calls to the new state helper methods (`addAgentObservation`, `setCurrentFile`, `updateCodebaseStructure`) within the `infer` loop, particularly after `generateText` and tool execution, to reflect the agent's actions and findings in its state. This makes the state dynamic and useful.
        *   **Good:** Added the public `setRepositoryContext` callable method for external control over the repo context, using `this.setState` correctly.

2.  **State Management Implementation:**
    *   The pattern is now correct: State definition in `types.ts`, state reading/formatting for prompt in `prompts.ts`, and state initialization/mutation within the `Coder` class methods in `server.ts` using `this.setState`.
    *   The additions of observations, task tracking, scratchpad updates, and codebase structure updates within the `infer` loop are great steps towards creating a more stateful and context-aware agent.

3.  **Clarity and Readability:** The refactoring significantly improves the clarity and organization of the code. Each file now has a much clearer responsibility.

**Conclusion:**

The agent performed the refactoring task very effectively, addressing all the key points from the previous feedback. The resulting code structure is much improved, with clear separation of concerns and correct state management patterns implemented within the `Coder` agent class. The integration of dynamic state updates (like observations and codebase mapping) into the agent's workflow is a significant enhancement.
