**Analysis:**

Excellent! Let's break down the results:

1.  **Decoding Fixed:** The logs show `[Process Tools] Successfully decoded content with TextDecoder (length: 477)`. This confirms the switch to `Buffer` (or the agent internally using `TextDecoder` as a fallback/alternative) successfully decoded the base64 content. The `atob` error is gone.
2.  **`updateCodebaseStructure` Called Correctly:** The logs confirm `[Process Tools] Calling updateCodebaseStructure for path: packages/agents/src/server.ts` was executed, and importantly, `[updateCodebaseStructure] Content length: 477` shows it received the *decoded* string content.
3.  **`generateObject` for Summary SUCCESS:**
    *   `[updateCodebaseStructure] Calling generateObject`
    *   `[updateCodebaseStructure] generateObject returned result: true`
    *   `[updateCodebaseStructure] Generated summary: The file 'server.ts' is responsible for setting up...`
    *   This is the key success! The call to `generateObject` (using the `smallModel` and the simplified prompt) completed successfully and returned a *meaningful summary*, unlike the previous attempt.
4.  **State Update SUCCESS:**
    *   The final state object shows the `codebase.structure` is populated correctly for `packages/agents/src/server.ts`.
    *   The `description` field now holds the useful summary generated by the `smallModel`: `"The file 'server.ts' is responsible for setting up and configuring the server for the application..."`
    *   The `tags` field is also populated with relevant tags: `["server", "api", "config"]`.
    *   The `observations` array correctly includes `"Analyzed file: packages/agents/src/server.ts. Purpose: The file 'server.ts' is respon..."`
5.  **UI Rendering:** You mentioned the UI looks good. The final message state includes both the `text` part and the `tool-invocation` part with `state: "result"`. This correctly renders the text *and* the tool result card, resolving the "empty component" issue from the previous step. The chronological order isn't perfect (card appears with the text), but it's displaying the necessary information.

**Conclusion:**

**Success!** All the outstanding issues seem to be resolved:

*   Base64 decoding is working robustly.
*   The logic correctly extracts tool results from the `steps` array.
*   `updateCodebaseStructure` receives the correct decoded content.
*   Using the `smallModel` (`gpt-4o-mini`) and the simplified prompt for `generateObject` successfully produces useful file summaries.
*   The agent's `codebase` state is now being enriched with meaningful, AI-generated analysis.
*   The UI is correctly displaying the tool result component again alongside the text response.

The agent is now fully functional in this tool-use-and-state-update cycle.
