# Schedule Implementation Report

## Overview

I've implemented the enhanced scheduling capabilities for the Coder agent as requested in the instructions. The implementation enables more flexible scheduling with different callback methods, structured payloads, integration with the agent's task system, and continuous execution.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Types (`types.ts`)

- Enhanced the `Task` interface with new fields:
  - `scheduleId` to link to system schedules
  - `payload` to store structured data
  - `callbackMethodName` to track which method will be called
  - Added `cancelled` to the status enum

- Added `isContinuousRunActive` to the `CoderState` interface to track whether continuous execution is enabled

### 2. Refactored Scheduling Tools (`tools.ts`)

- Enhanced `scheduleTask` to support:
  - Flexible callback methods (currently `executeTask` and `continueInfer`)
  - Structured payload passing
  - Integration with agent tasks

- Renamed tools for clarity:
  - `listScheduledTasks` → `listSystemSchedules`
  - `deleteScheduledTask` → `deleteSystemSchedule`

- Added a new `listAgentTasks` tool to show tasks from the agent's internal state

- Updated tool return values to include more useful information like schedule IDs

### 3. Implemented Agent Methods (`server.ts`)

- Updated `addAgentTask` to support the new fields (schedule ID, payload, callback method)
  - Made it public so tools can access it

- Added `cancelTaskByScheduleId` method to mark tasks as cancelled when schedules are deleted

- Updated `executeTask` to handle structured payloads instead of just string descriptions

- Implemented a robust `continueInfer` method that:
  - Runs the main inference loop
  - Reschedules itself for continuous execution if enabled
  - Includes error handling with backoff

- Added start/stop controls for continuous operation:
  - `startContinuousRun` - Activates continuous mode and kicks off the first run
  - `stopContinuousRun` - Deactivates continuous mode and cancels pending schedules

## Enhanced Features

1. **Flexible Callback Methods**:  
   Instead of only supporting `executeTask`, the system now allows scheduling different methods (currently `executeTask` and `continueInfer`).

2. **Structured Payloads**:  
   Both scheduling and task management now support structured JSON payloads instead of just string descriptions.

3. **State Integration**:  
   System-level schedules are now linked with agent tasks via the `scheduleId`, creating a cohesive task management system.

4. **Continuous Operation**:  
   The agent can now run continuously by scheduling itself to wake up and process tasks at regular intervals.

5. **Improved Task Listing**:  
   Different tools for listing system schedules vs. agent tasks, with better formatting.

## Technical Details

### Task Scheduling Process

1. When `scheduleTask` is called:
   - Determines the appropriate timing input (date, delay, or cron)
   - Calls `agent.schedule()` with the callback method name and payload
   - Adds a corresponding entry to the agent's tasks
   - Returns the schedule ID for reference

2. Schedule Execution:
   - When a schedule fires, it calls the specified method (e.g. `executeTask` or `continueInfer`)
   - Passes the stored payload to provide context
   - For `executeTask`, adds a user message and runs inference
   - For `continueInfer`, runs inference and may reschedule itself

### Continuous Execution Model

- The agent maintains a boolean flag `isContinuousRunActive` in its state
- When activated via `startContinuousRun`:
  1. Sets the flag to true
  2. Immediately starts the first execution via `continueInfer`
  3. After each execution completes, it checks the flag
  4. If still active, it schedules the next run (typically 60 seconds later)
  5. On errors, uses a longer delay (5 minutes) before retrying

- When deactivated via `stopContinuousRun`:
  1. Sets the flag to false
  2. Finds and cancels any pending `continueInfer` schedules

This implementation provides a robust foundation for long-running tasks and automated operation, while maintaining the ability to stop execution when needed.
