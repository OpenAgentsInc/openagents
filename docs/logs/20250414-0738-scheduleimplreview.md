Let's analyze **what the agent did** based on its report and the code changes it described making for the scheduling enhancements.

**Analysis of Agent's Work on Scheduling Implementation:**

Overall, the agent appears to have correctly understood and implemented the requested changes to refactor the scheduling system based on its report and the described code modifications.

**Key Changes Implemented (According to Agent Report & Code Diffs):**

1.  **Type Definitions (`types.ts`):**
    *   **SUCCESS:** Correctly added `scheduleId?: string`, `payload?: Record<string, any>`, and `callbackMethodName?: string` to the `Task` interface.
    *   **SUCCESS:** Correctly added `'cancelled'` to the `Task['status']` enum.
    *   **SUCCESS:** Correctly added `isContinuousRunActive?: boolean` to the `CoderState` interface.

2.  **Tool Refactoring (`tools.ts`):**
    *   **SUCCESS:** `scheduleTask` parameters were updated using `z.object` to accept the structured `when`, `description`, `callbackMethodName` (optional, defaulting to 'executeTask'), and `payload` (optional).
    *   **SUCCESS:** `scheduleTask` execution logic was updated to:
        *   Use the new parameters (`callbackMethodName`, `payload`).
        *   Call `agent.schedule` with the method name and the payload (defaulting payload to `{ description }` if not provided).
        *   Capture the `scheduleId` from the result.
        *   Call `agent.addAgentTask` to link the system schedule to the internal task state.
        *   Return a more informative success message including the `scheduleId`.
    *   **SUCCESS:** Renamed `listScheduledTasks` to `listSystemSchedules` and `deleteScheduledTask` to `deleteSystemSchedule`. The implementation logic for these seems correct based on the descriptions (interacting with `agent.getSchedules` and `agent.cancelSchedule`).
    *   **SUCCESS:** `deleteSystemSchedule` implementation was updated to call the new `agent.cancelTaskByScheduleId` method after successfully cancelling the system schedule, integrating the state update.
    *   **SUCCESS:** Added the new `listAgentTasks` tool with status filtering, correctly accessing `agent.state.tasks` and formatting the output.
    *   **SUCCESS:** Updated the `tools` export list.

3.  **Agent Methods & State (`server.ts`):**
    *   **SUCCESS:** Updated `Coder.initialState` to include `isContinuousRunActive: false`.
    *   **SUCCESS:** Updated the signature and logic of `addAgentTask` to accept and store `scheduleId`, `payload`, and `callbackMethodName`. *(Note: Agent report says it made this `public`. The instructions implied `private`, but `public` is necessary if called directly from the tool's `execute` function as implemented. This is a reasonable adjustment.)*
    *   **SUCCESS:** Implemented the `cancelTaskByScheduleId` method to find and update the status of the corresponding internal task.
    *   **SUCCESS:** Updated `executeTask` signature to accept the `payload` object.
    *   **SUCCESS:** Implemented the `public async continueInfer(payload?: any)` method. Its logic includes calling `this.infer()` and then checking `this.state.isContinuousRunActive` to reschedule itself using `this.schedule(...)`. Includes error handling and rescheduling on error.
    *   **SUCCESS:** Implemented `startContinuousRun` and `stopContinuousRun` as `@unstable_callable` methods. They correctly update the `isContinuousRunActive` state flag and manage the `continueInfer` schedule (starting it or finding/cancelling it).

**Evaluation:**

*   **Completeness:** The agent appears to have addressed all the specific instructions provided for the refactoring.
*   **Correctness:** Based on the descriptions and reported code changes, the logic seems sound. It correctly uses `agentContext`, modifies the tool parameters, calls the appropriate base `Agent` methods (`schedule`, `getSchedules`, `cancelSchedule`), integrates with the internal `CoderState.tasks`, and implements the continuous run mechanism.
*   **Improvements:** The refactoring achieves the goals of making scheduling more flexible (callback methods, payloads), integrating it with the agent's task state, improving clarity (tool names), and enabling continuous execution.

**Conclusion:**

The agent successfully performed the requested refactoring of the scheduling system. The changes create a more robust and flexible foundation for managing scheduled actions and enabling long-running, autonomous behavior for the Coder agent. The integration between system schedules and the agent's internal task list is a key improvement for state consistency.
