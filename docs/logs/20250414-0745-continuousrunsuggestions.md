Okay, here are a few prompt options to test the new scheduling functionality, specifically designed to use the `continueInfer` mechanism for repeated actions like traversing a codebase.

Choose the one that best fits the level of detail you want the agent to handle initially.

**Option 1: Simple Repo Scan (Broad)**

```
Start a continuous run to explore the 'openagentsinc/openagents' repository on the 'main' branch. Every minute, pick a directory you haven't explored deeply yet, list its contents using the appropriate tool, and summarize one file within it. Update your internal codebase map as you go.
```

*   **Why:** Tests `startContinuousRun`, `continueInfer`, self-rescheduling, use of `get_file_contents` (implicitly needed to list/read), and `updateCodebaseStructure`. Sets a longer interval (1 minute) to avoid excessive API calls during testing.
*   **How it works:** `startContinuousRun` activates the loop. Each `continueInfer` cycle, the agent should use its state (`codebase`, `observations`, `scratchpad`) to decide which directory/file to look at next, call `get_file_contents`, update the state via `updateCodebaseStructure`, and then `continueInfer` reschedules itself.

**Option 2: Focused Directory Traversal**

```
Start a continuous run focused on the 'packages/agents/src' directory in the 'openagentsinc/openagents' repository ('codertest' branch). Every 30 seconds, use the get_file_contents tool to read one TypeScript file from this directory that you haven't summarized yet. Analyze it and update your codebase state. Stop once you have analyzed 5 files in this directory.
```

*   **Why:** More focused than Option 1. Tests continuous run, tool use, state updates, and potentially requires the agent to track which files it has already analyzed within the `continueInfer` logic or scratchpad. Introduces a stopping condition based on state.
*   **How it works:** Similar to Option 1, but the agent's internal logic within `continueInfer` needs to be smarter to select unanalyzed files within the target directory and count how many it has done to eventually set `isContinuousRunActive` to `false` (or call `stopContinuousRun`). *Note: The agent doesn't currently have built-in logic to stop after 'N' files, so it would likely run indefinitely until you manually called `stopContinuousRun` unless you add that stopping logic.*

**Option 3: Dependency Mapping (More Complex)**

```
Start a continuous run to map the dependencies within the 'packages/agents/src' directory ('openagentsinc/openagents' repo, 'codertest' branch). Every 45 seconds:
1. Pick a *.ts file you haven't fully analyzed.
2. Use get_file_contents to read it.
3. Analyze its imports using generateObject or text analysis to identify local imports (within './' or '../').
4. Add the identified dependencies to the file's metadata in your codebase state.
5. Prioritize analyzing files that were identified as dependencies but haven't been analyzed yet.
Continue until you have analyzed at least 5 files.
```

*   **Why:** Tests a more complex reasoning cycle within `continueInfer`. Requires the agent to not only read files but also perform specific analysis (dependency identification) and use that analysis to guide its next steps (prioritizing unanalyzed dependencies). Requires the `FileSummarySchema` and `updateCodebaseStructure` logic to handle `dependencies` correctly.
*   **How it works:** This requires the most sophisticated logic within `continueInfer`. The agent needs to look at `this.state.codebase`, find analyzed files, extract dependencies, compare them to files already analyzed, select the next target, use the tool, call `generateObject` (perhaps with a specific prompt for dependency analysis), update state, and reschedule. Again, the stopping condition needs explicit logic.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **API Rate Limits:** Running tasks every 10 seconds is likely too fast and will hit GitHub API rate limits quickly. Start with longer intervals (30-60 seconds or more) for testing.
*   **Stopping Logic:** The current `continueInfer` reschedules indefinitely if `isContinuousRunActive` is true. You will need to use the `stopContinuousRun` callable method manually, or the agent needs internal logic within `continueInfer` to set `isContinuousRunActive` to `false` based on achieving a goal (like analyzing N files). Prompting it to stop after N files (like in Option 2 & 3) relies on the agent correctly interpreting and implementing that stopping condition within its `continueInfer` loop.
*   **Error Handling:** Observe how the agent handles errors during the continuous run (e.g., file not found, API errors, `generateObject` failures). The current `continueInfer` includes basic rescheduling after errors.
*   **Tool Name:** Ensure the user prompt uses the correct tool name if explicitly mentioning it (e.g., `get_file_contents`).

Choose Option 1 for the simplest test, Option 2 for a slightly more focused test, or Option 3 for a more complex reasoning test. Remember to adjust the timing interval.
