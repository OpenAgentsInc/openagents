# Schedule UI Implementation

## Overview

I've implemented the UI elements for displaying task counts and providing play/pause controls for the continuous execution feature. These elements are now integrated into the app header section, providing users with visibility into the agent's tasks and allowing them to control long-running operations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated App Header

- Added a new section below the main header to house the task counts and controls
- Implemented a grid layout with two columns to organize the information

### 2. Task Counts Panel

- Created a task count display that shows:
  - Individual counts for each task status (pending, in-progress, completed, failed, cancelled)
  - Total task count
  - Conditionally renders count items only when they're greater than zero
  - Added visual indicators including a list icon and color-coding (red for failed tasks)

### 3. Continuous Run Controls

- Implemented a continuous run status indicator showing:
  - Current state (Active/Inactive) with color-coding
  - A visual icon that changes between Play/Pause based on the current state
  - A button to toggle continuous run that calls the corresponding agent methods

### 4. Agent State Integration

- Added the `rawState` state variable to track the full agent state
- Implemented `useMemo` to efficiently calculate task counts when the tasks array changes
- Connected agent callbacks:
  - `onStateUpdate` - Updates the local state and connection status
  - `onConnect` - Sets connection status and clears errors
  - `onDisconnect` - Handles disconnection events
  - `onError` - Captures and displays agent errors

### 5. Connection Status Indicators

- Added a connection status indicator that appears when not connected
- Shows connection state (connecting/disconnected) and any error messages

## Technical Implementation

### Reactive Task Counts

The task counts are calculated with `useMemo` to optimize performance:

```tsx
const taskCounts = useMemo(() => {
  const tasks = rawState?.tasks || [];
  return {
    pending: tasks.filter((t: any) => t.status === 'pending').length,
    inProgress: tasks.filter((t: any) => t.status === 'in-progress').length,
    completed: tasks.filter((t: any) => t.status === 'completed').length,
    failed: tasks.filter((t: any) => t.status === 'failed').length,
    cancelled: tasks.filter((t: any) => t.status === 'cancelled').length,
    total: tasks.length,
  };
}, [rawState?.tasks]);
```

### Continuous Run Toggle Handler

The handler for toggling continuous execution:

```tsx
const handleToggleContinuousRun = async () => {
  if (!agent || connectionStatus !== 'connected') return;

  const currentlyActive = rawState?.isContinuousRunActive || false;
  console.log(`Toggling continuous run. Currently active: ${currentlyActive}`);

  try {
    if (currentlyActive) {
      await agent.stopContinuousRun();
    } else {
      await agent.startContinuousRun();
    }
    // State update will come via onStateUpdate
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error toggling continuous run:", error);
    setConnectionError(`Failed to ${currentlyActive ? 'stop' : 'start'} continuous run: ${error.message || 'Unknown error'}`);
  }
};
```

## UI Experience

The implementation provides a clean and intuitive interface:

1. **Task Visibility**: Users can quickly see the number of tasks in each state and the total count
2. **Status Awareness**: The continuous run state is clearly indicated with both text and icons
3. **Simple Controls**: A single button toggles between starting and stopping continuous execution
4. **Feedback**: Connection states and errors are visible when issues occur

## Design Considerations

- **Compact Layout**: Used a grid layout to make efficient use of space
- **Conditional Rendering**: Only shows task counts when they're greater than zero to reduce clutter
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Used color, spacing, and typography to create clear visual hierarchy
- **Responsive Labels**: Button and status text change based on the current state
- **Graceful Degradation**: Disables controls when agent is disconnected

This implementation provides users with a clear view of the agent's internal state and convenient controls for the new continuous execution feature.
