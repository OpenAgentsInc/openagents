# Schedule UI Implementation

## Overview

I've implemented the UI elements for displaying task counts and providing play/pause controls for the continuous execution feature. These elements have been integrated into the agent page sidebar, providing users with visibility into the agent's tasks and allowing them to control long-running operations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Imports and Dependencies

- Added `useMemo` from React for efficient calculation of task counts
- Added `Button` component from the Shadcn UI library
- Added new icons: `Play`, `Pause`, and `ListTodo` from Lucide

```tsx
import { useEffect, useState, useRef, useMemo } from "react";
import { Button } from "~/components/ui/button";
import { ChevronDown, AlertCircle, CheckCircle, ArrowUp, Play, Pause, ListTodo } from "lucide-react";
```

### 2. Task Count Calculation

Created a memoized function that processes the raw agent state to derive task counts:

```tsx
// Calculate task counts from agent state
const taskCounts = useMemo(() => {
  const tasks = rawState?.tasks || [];
  return {
    pending: tasks.filter((t: any) => t.status === 'pending').length,
    inProgress: tasks.filter((t: any) => t.status === 'in-progress').length,
    completed: tasks.filter((t: any) => t.status === 'completed').length,
    failed: tasks.filter((t: any) => t.status === 'failed').length,
    cancelled: tasks.filter((t: any) => t.status === 'cancelled').length,
    total: tasks.length,
  };
}, [rawState?.tasks]);
```

This calculation only runs when the tasks array changes, improving performance.

### 3. Continuous Run Toggle Handler

Implemented a handler for toggling the continuous execution state:

```tsx
const handleToggleContinuousRun = async () => {
  if (!agent || connectionStatus !== 'connected') return;

  const currentlyActive = rawState?.isContinuousRunActive || false;
  console.log(`Toggling continuous run. Currently active: ${currentlyActive}`);

  try {
    if (currentlyActive) {
      await agent.stopContinuousRun(); // Call backend method
      console.log("Called stopContinuousRun");
    } else {
      await agent.startContinuousRun(); // Call backend method
      console.log("Called startContinuousRun");
    }
    // State update will come via onStateUpdate, no need to set locally here
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error toggling continuous run:", error);
    setConnectionError(`Failed to ${currentlyActive ? 'stop' : 'start'} continuous run: ${error.message || 'Unknown error'}`);
  }
};
```

This handler:
- Checks the current state through `rawState?.isContinuousRunActive`
- Calls the appropriate agent method based on the current state
- Relies on the existing `onStateUpdate` handler to update the UI
- Provides proper error handling

### 4. UI Components in Sidebar

Added the task count display and controls to the agent sidebar:

```tsx
{/* Task counts and controls */}
<div className="mt-3 pt-3 border-t border-border/50">
  <Label className="text-xs font-semibold text-muted-foreground flex items-center gap-1.5 mb-2">
    <ListTodo className="w-3.5 h-3.5" /> Agent Tasks
  </Label>
  <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-x-2 gap-y-1 text-xs mb-3">
    {(taskCounts.pending > 0) && <div>Pending: {taskCounts.pending}</div>}
    {(taskCounts.inProgress > 0) && <div>In Progress: {taskCounts.inProgress}</div>}
    {(taskCounts.completed > 0) && <div>Completed: {taskCounts.completed}</div>}
    {(taskCounts.failed > 0) && <div className="text-red-600 dark:text-red-500">Failed: {taskCounts.failed}</div>}
    {(taskCounts.cancelled > 0) && <div>Cancelled: {taskCounts.cancelled}</div>}
    <div className="col-span-2 mt-1 pt-1 border-t border-border/20">Total: {taskCounts.total}</div>
  </div>

  <Label className="text-xs font-semibold text-muted-foreground block mb-2">
    Continuous Run
  </Label>
  <Button
    variant="outline"
    size="sm"
    className="w-full h-8 text-xs"
    onClick={handleToggleContinuousRun}
    disabled={connectionStatus !== 'connected'} // Disable if not connected
  >
    {rawState?.isContinuousRunActive ? (
      <><Pause className="w-3 h-3 mr-2" /> Pause Run</>
    ) : (
      <><Play className="w-3 h-3 mr-2" /> Start Run</>
    )}
  </Button>
</div>
```

Key features of the UI:
- **Conditional Rendering**: Only shows task counts when values are > 0, reducing clutter
- **Grid Layout**: Uses a responsive 2-column grid for efficient space usage
- **Visual Indicators**: 
  - Color-coding (red for failed tasks)
  - Dynamic icon changes between Play/Pause based on state
  - Clear section headings with icons
- **Connection-Aware**: Button is disabled when agent is not connected
- **Styled Consistently**: Uses the existing design language (borders, spacing, typography)

### 5. Layout Improvements

Made a small but important improvement to the sidebar layout to ensure proper spacing:

```tsx
<div className="p-4 mt-auto"> {/* Added mt-auto to push this section down */}
  {/* GitHub Token Input */}
  <GitHubTokenInput />
  ...
</div>
```

The `mt-auto` class helps push the GitHub token input to the bottom of the sidebar when there's available space.

## Technical Considerations

1. **Reactive Updates**: The UI reactively updates based on the agent's state. When the continuous run state changes on the backend, the UI updates automatically through the existing `onStateUpdate` mechanism.

2. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling and feedback is provided when operations fail.

3. **Performance**: The `useMemo` hook ensures task count calculations are only performed when the task list changes, not on every render.

4. **Accessibility**: The UI follows accessibility patterns with proper labeling and button states.

5. **Type Safety**: When possible, TypeScript typing is leveraged for safer code.

## User Experience

From a user experience perspective, this implementation:

1. **Provides Visibility**: Users can quickly see how many tasks are in each state
2. **Enables Control**: The play/pause button allows users to easily start or stop continuous execution
3. **Shows Status**: Visual indicators make the current state clear at a glance
4. **Maintains Context**: The information is available without requiring navigation away from the chat interface

## Integration with Backend

The UI interacts with the backend through two primary methods:

1. **Method Calls**: `agent.startContinuousRun()` and `agent.stopContinuousRun()`
2. **State Updates**: The backend sends state updates via WebSocket, which are processed by the `onStateUpdate` handler

This implementation completes the feature by connecting the UI to the previously implemented backend scheduling functionality.
