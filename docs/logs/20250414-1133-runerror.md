Okay, we've got a new error, but this one is very informative and points directly to the problem in the agent's *internal reasoning* when trying to schedule its next step.

**Analysis of Logs and Error:**

1.  **Initial User Message:** You sent the message instructing the agent to start the continuous run. The agent correctly processed the `githubToken` and ran `infer` once. The scratchpad shows it understood the goal ("initiate a continuous run") but it **did not** automatically call `startContinuousRun` based on the message alone. This confirms the LLM didn't interpret "Start a continuous run..." as a command to use the function.
2.  **Button Click:** You clicked "Start Run".
    *   The frontend correctly sent the `{'type': 'command', 'command': 'startContinuousRun'}` message.
    *   The backend `onMessage` correctly received and processed this command.
    *   The `startContinuousRun` method executed, set `isContinuousRunActive` to `true` (visible in the updated state), added the "Starting continuous agent execution" observation, and called `continueInfer` for the first time.
3.  **`continueInfer` (First Cycle):**
    *   Logs show `[continueInfer] Agent waking up. Payload: {"reason":"initial start"}`.
    *   It called `await this.infer()` internally.
    *   **Inside `infer` (Error Occurs):** The core `infer` logic ran. Because `isContinuousRunActive` was true and there was no new user message, the agent's LLM (the main `model`) must have decided to act on the goal set in the initial prompt ("explore the repo..."). It likely decided the next action was to **schedule the next exploration step** using the `scheduleTask` tool.
    *   **Tool Call Failure:** The LLM attempted to call the `scheduleTask` tool, but it generated **invalid arguments** for it, causing the `AI_InvalidToolArgumentsError`.
4.  **The Error Breakdown:**
    ```
    AI_InvalidToolArgumentsError: Invalid arguments for tool scheduleTask: Type validation failed: Value: {"when":{"type":"cron","cron":"*/1 * * * *"},"callbackMethodName":"continueInfer","payload":{"branch":"main","repo_owner":"openagentsinc","queued_dirs":["/"],"explored_dirs":[],"repo_name":"openagents","summarized_files":[]},"description":"Explore openagentsinc/openagents repo (main branch)"}.
    Error message: [
      {
        "code": "invalid_type",
        "expected": "string",        // Zod expected a string here
        "received": "undefined",    // The LLM didn't provide it
        "path": [ "when", "description" ], // Problem is within the 'when' object, it's missing 'description'
        "message": "Required"
      },
      {
        "code": "invalid_type",
        "expected": "object",       // Zod expected an object here
        "received": "undefined",    // The LLM didn't provide it
        "path": [ "when", "when" ],    // Problem is within the 'when' object, it's missing 'when' itself (this seems wrong based on value?)
        "message": "Required"
      }
    ]
    ```
    *   **Root Cause:** The `scheduleTask` tool's parameters schema requires the top-level arguments to be `{ when: unstable_scheduleSchema, description: z.string(), ... }`. The LLM generated arguments where the main `description` was present, but the required `description` *within* the `when` object (defined by `unstable_scheduleSchema`) was missing. The second error path `["when", "when"]` seems like a Zod/schema parsing artifact, the key issue is the missing `when.description`.
    *   **Why did the LLM do this?** The LLM controlling the main `infer` loop is trying to be helpful and use the scheduling tool to manage its continuous run, but it's getting confused about the nested structure required by `unstable_scheduleSchema` versus the top-level parameters of the `scheduleTask` tool itself. It put the main task description at the top level but didn't add one inside the `when` object.

5.  **Error Handling:** The `catch` block in `continueInfer` correctly caught the error and rescheduled `continueInfer` after a 300-second delay.

**Instructions for Agent:**

"The continuous run started correctly when the button was clicked, but it failed during the first `infer` cycle within `continueInfer`.

**Problem:** The main LLM, when deciding how to proceed with the continuous exploration, tried to use the `scheduleTask` tool to schedule its *next* step (likely calling `continueInfer` again with a payload related to exploration). However, it generated **invalid arguments** for the `scheduleTask` tool, specifically missing the required `description` field *within* the `when` object, causing an `AI_InvalidToolArgumentsError`.

**Solution:** We should NOT be using the `scheduleTask` *tool* from within the agent's internal `continueInfer` loop to reschedule itself. The `continueInfer` method should use the agent's *direct* scheduling capability (`this.schedule`) as it was correctly implemented previously. The `scheduleTask` *tool* is meant for the *user* (via the LLM interpreting user requests) to schedule arbitrary tasks.

1.  **Verify `continueInfer` Logic:** Double-check the `continueInfer` method in `src/server.ts`. Ensure that the rescheduling logic *only* uses `await this.schedule(...)` and **does not** involve the LLM trying to call the `scheduleTask` *tool*."

    *   "Confirm the rescheduling block inside `continueInfer` looks like this (especially the `this.schedule` call):"
        ```typescript
            // Inside continueInfer, after `await this.infer();`
            if (this.state.isContinuousRunActive) {
                const delayInSeconds = 60; // Or your desired interval
                console.log(`[continueInfer] Rescheduling self in ${delayInSeconds} seconds.`);
                // *** Ensure it uses this.schedule directly ***
                await this.schedule(delayInSeconds, 'continueInfer', { reason: 'continuous execution' });
            } else {
                console.log(`[continueInfer] Not rescheduling - continuous run inactive.`);
            }
        ```
    *   "Confirm the error handling block *also* uses `this.schedule` directly:"
        ```typescript
            // Inside the catch block of continueInfer
            if (this.state.isContinuousRunActive) {
                const delayInSeconds = 300; // Or your desired error backoff
                console.log(`[continueInfer] Rescheduling self after error in ${delayInSeconds} seconds.`);
                 // *** Ensure it uses this.schedule directly ***
                await this.schedule(delayInSeconds, 'continueInfer', { reason: 'error recovery' });
            }
        ```

2.  **Remove Confusing LLM Behavior (If Necessary):** If the LLM *inside* the main `infer` call is still trying to call the `scheduleTask` tool during a continuous run cycle (which it shouldn't need to do, as `continueInfer` handles the rescheduling), we might need to adjust the system prompt further.
    *   **(Optional - Add only if step 1 doesn't fix it)** Add a guideline to `src/prompts.ts`'s `getSystemPrompt` function:"
        ```diff
        // Add usage guidelines
        systemPrompt += `\n\nGUIDELINES:
        1. ... (existing guidelines) ...
        +10. CONTINUOUS RUN: When operating in continuous run mode (triggered by `startContinuousRun`), focus on performing the exploration/analysis steps for the current cycle (e.g., read a file, update state). The rescheduling of the next cycle is handled automatically by the `continueInfer` function; you do not need to use the `scheduleTask` tool for self-rescheduling during a continuous run.
        ```

**Explanation:**

*   The agent's internal logic for continuing the run (`continueInfer`) should use the direct `this.schedule` primitive provided by the base class.
*   The `scheduleTask` *tool* is an interface for the LLM to schedule things based on *user requests*, not for the agent's core loop to manage itself.
*   The error occurred because the main LLM (in `infer`) misinterpreted its role during the continuous run and tried to use the wrong mechanism (`scheduleTask` tool) with incorrect arguments to schedule the next step, instead of letting the outer `continueInfer` function handle it correctly with `this.schedule`.

Apply these checks/changes, focusing on ensuring `continueInfer` uses `this.schedule` and not the `scheduleTask` tool."
