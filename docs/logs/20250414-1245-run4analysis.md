Okay, let's trace the sequence of events again carefully. This reveals the state persistence issue we suspected earlier.

**Analysis:**

1.  **Message 1: Set Context**
    *   You send: "Set repo context to openagentsinc/openagents main branch"
    *   `onMessage` receives it, updates the token (if needed), calls `infer`.
    *   `infer` runs.
    *   The `[Intent Check]` sees this is *not* a start/stop command.
    *   The `[Task Gen]` check sees it's *not* a task generation command.
    *   `generateText` runs. It decides the correct action is to *conceptually* set the context and respond. It *doesn't* actually call the `setRepositoryContext` method/tool in this turn.
    *   The agent responds: "Okay, I have set the repository context..." (even though it hasn't updated its internal state yet).
    *   The state *after* this first message **still shows `currentRepoOwner: undefined`**. The `infer` call didn't trigger the state update for the repo context.

2.  **Message 2: Request Continuous Run Goal**
    *   You send: "I want you to explore the repository continuously..."
    *   `onMessage` receives it, calls `infer`.
    *   `infer` runs.
    *   The `[Intent Check]` sees this message does *not* exactly match "start a continuous run..." (it's missing the word "start" at the beginning), so it doesn't automatically call `startContinuousRun`.
    *   The `[Task Gen]` check *does* match keywords ("explore", "list", "summarize", "update") and terms ("repository", "directory", "file", "map"), so it incorrectly calls `generateAndAddTask`. A task is added to the state.
    *   `generateText` runs. The LLM decides to ask clarifying questions about the continuous run.
    *   Agent responds: "Okay, I can set up... 1. How would you like updates...? 2. Is there a specific number...?"
    *   State after message 2 shows the new user/assistant messages, the incorrectly generated task, but still **no repo context** and `isContinuousRunActive` is `false`.

3.  **Message 3: Confirm Continuous Run Details**
    *   You send: "here in this chat. continue until instructed otherwise."
    *   `onMessage` receives it, calls `infer`.
    *   `infer` runs.
    *   `[Intent Check]` doesn't match start/stop.
    *   `[Task Gen]` doesn't match task keywords for *this specific user message*.
    *   `generateText` runs. The LLM now understands the parameters for the continuous run. It decides to **perform the first cycle's actions directly**: list `/`, then summarize `README.md`.
    *   The `steps` array shows it calls `get_file_contents` for `/`, then `get_file_contents` for `README.md`, then generates the final text.
    *   The `[Process Tools]` loop runs correctly for the `README.md` tool result (the second tool call). It decodes the content and calls `updateCodebaseStructure`.
    *   `updateCodebaseStructure` runs, calls `generateObject` which fails because `content` is the *directory listing* from the first tool call (this seems like a bug in processing the *first* tool call's result). **Correction:** Looking closer, the log `Generated summary: The README.md file typically serves...` shows it *did* summarize `README.md`. However, the *final state* shows a bad summary for `README.md` ("corrupted or unreadable binary data"). This indicates conflicting updates or state overwriting. The log `Analyzed file: README.md. Purpose: The README.md file typically s...` suggests the observation was added correctly *before* the final state was snapshotted.
    *   Agent responds with the summary of `README.md` and says "End of Cycle 1. The next cycle will automatically trigger...". This text is generated by the LLM **even though `isContinuousRunActive` is still `false`**.
    *   State after message 3 shows the summary message added, the `codebase` entry for `README.md` has the *bad* summary, but `isContinuousRunActive` is **still `false`**. The repo context is still missing.

4.  **Button Click: "Start Run"**
    *   You click the button.
    *   `onMessage` receives `command: 'startContinuousRun'`.
    *   `startContinuousRun` is called.
    *   `isContinuousRunActive` is set to `true`. Observation added.
    *   `continueInfer` is called.
    *   `continueInfer` logs state: `[continueInfer STATE CHECK] Owner: undefined, Repo: undefined, Active: true`. **This confirms the repo context was never persisted correctly.**
    *   `planNextExplorationStep` runs.
    *   The check `!this.state.currentRepoOwner || !this.state.currentRepoName` **fails** because the state loaded by the DO doesn't have the context.
    *   It adds the observation "Please set the repository context...".
    *   It calls `stopContinuousRun`.
    *   `stopContinuousRun` sets `isContinuousRunActive` back to `false`.
    *   `continueInfer` returns `null` (or the planner does).
    *   `continueInfer` sees no `nextAction`, logs "No further exploration steps...", and **reschedules itself** for the next planning cycle (because the `stopContinuousRun` call within the planner doesn't prevent the rescheduling logic later in `continueInfer` from running).

**Root Causes:**

1.  **`setRepositoryContext` Not Called:** The initial message "Set repo context..." was processed by `infer`, and the LLM responded textually but **never actually called the `setRepositoryContext` method** to update the agent's state. The `@unstable_callable` decorator might still be the intended way to invoke this, or the LLM needs to be explicitly told to use a specific tool/function for setting context if one exists.
2.  **State Loss / Reset (Still Suspect):** The fact that `continueInfer` woke up with `undefined` owner/repo *despite* the LLM having discussed it extensively suggests the state set by `setRepositoryContext` (if it *had* been called) might not have persisted reliably across the Durable Object's sleep/wake cycle. This is less likely if `this.setState` is used correctly, but the logs make it a possibility.
3.  **Flawed `infer` Intent Handling:** The `infer` method's logic for detecting intents ("start run", "set context", "generate task") based on user message content is brittle and led to incorrect actions (generating a task when asked to start run, not calling `setRepositoryContext` when asked).
4.  **Confusing Continuous Run Start:** The agent started performing exploration steps *before* the continuous run was actually activated via the command, leading to confusing state and logs.

**Revised Instructions for Agent:**

"The agent is still confused about setting the repository context and starting the continuous run. The core issue is that the `setRepositoryContext` method is likely not being called when the user asks, and the state might not be persisting correctly when the continuous run *does* start.

1.  **Fix Repository Context Setting:**
    *   **Option A (Expose as Tool):** The most reliable way might be to define `setRepositoryContext` as a standard tool in `tools.ts` instead of using `@unstable_callable`.
        *   Define a Zod schema for its parameters (`owner: z.string(), repo: z.string(), branch: z.string().optional()`).
        *   Create a `tool()` definition in `tools.ts` that calls `agent.setRepositoryContext()` internally via `agentContext.getStore()`.
        *   Remove the `@unstable_callable` decorator from `setRepositoryContext` in `server.ts` and make the method `public` if needed for the tool to call it.
        *   Update the system prompt (`src/prompts.ts`) to clearly list this `set_repository_context` tool and instruct the LLM to use it when asked to set the context.
    *   **Option B (Improve Intent Detection):** If keeping `@unstable_callable`, refine the intent detection in `infer` *much* more carefully to parse owner, repo, and branch from the user message and *explicitly call* `this.setRepositoryContext(owner, repo, branch)` within `infer` when that intent is detected. This is more complex and error-prone than using a tool. **Let's try Option A (Tool) first.**

2.  **Ensure `infer` Doesn't Pre-run Continuous Actions:** Add a check within `infer` to prevent it from performing exploration steps (like calling tools related to listing/summarizing) if the user's intent was *only* to set context or describe the continuous run, *before* the run is actually started."
    *   "Modify the main `generateText` call logic. If the intent detected was 'set context' or 'describe continuous run', maybe the LLM prompt should just ask it to confirm the action or ask clarifying questions, rather than letting it call tools like `get_file_contents` immediately." (This is complex prompt engineering).

3.  **Verify State Persistence on Wake-up:** Keep the state logging added previously (`[continueInfer STATE CHECK]`, `[scheduledListFiles STATE CHECK]`, etc.). When testing *after* successfully setting the context AND *then* starting the run, these logs are critical to confirm `currentRepoOwner` and `currentRepoName` have the correct values when the scheduled methods execute. If they are `undefined` even after `setRepositoryContext` was successfully called and state updated, it points to a Durable Object persistence issue.

**Revised Test Plan:**

1.  **Implement Fix #1 (Expose `setRepositoryContext` as a tool).**
2.  **Test Setting Context:**
    *   Send message: "Use the set_repository_context tool to set owner='openagentsinc', repo='openagents', branch='main'."
    *   **Check Logs:** Verify the tool runs and `setRepositoryContext` is called on the backend.
    *   **Check State:** Verify `currentRepoOwner`, `currentRepoName`, `currentBranch` are correctly populated in the agent state.
3.  **Test Starting Run:**
    *   Click "Start Run" button.
    *   **Check Logs:** Verify `continueInfer` starts and the `[continueInfer STATE CHECK]` log shows the *correct* owner and repo names. Verify `planNextExplorationStep` plans `listFiles /`. Verify `scheduledListFiles` is scheduled.
4.  **Test First Action:**
    *   Wait for `scheduledListFiles` to run.
    *   **Check Logs:** Verify `[scheduledListFiles STATE CHECK]` shows the correct owner/repo. Verify the GitHub API call uses the correct owner/repo. Verify state update happens.
5.  **Test Second Planning Cycle:**
    *   Wait for the next `continueInfer`.
    *   **Check Logs:** Verify `[continueInfer STATE CHECK]` *still* shows the correct owner/repo. Verify it plans the next step (e.g., `summarizeFile README.md`).

Focus on making the context setting explicit and reliable using a tool first."
