Okay, let's break down this latest run. It seems the agent *still* isn't setting the repository context correctly when asked, and the continuous run logic has a flaw in its rescheduling.

**Analysis of Events and Logs:**

1.  **Message 1: "Set repo context..."**
    *   **Log:** `Processing githubToken update...` - This log comes from the `onMessage` handler. It seems the handler *only* checked for `parsedMessage.githubToken` and then directly called `this.infer()`. It **did not** check for `parsedMessage.type === 'command'` nor did it have any logic to parse the `userMessage` content itself within `onMessage`.
    *   **Log:** `[Intent Check] Checking user message: "Set repo context..."` - The `infer` method starts.
    *   **Log:** `[Intent Check] ... Suggesting tool usage.` - The `infer` method *correctly identifies* the intent to set the repo context based on the keywords.
    *   **Log:** `[Task Gen] Last user message does not match task criteria.` - Correct.
    *   **Log:** `[Process Tools] Processing 0 consolidated tool invocations...` - **This is the key failure.** Even though the intent was detected, the LLM (called by `generateText`) **did not choose to use the `setRepositoryContext` tool**. Instead, it generated a text response confirming the action *without actually performing it*.
    *   **State:** The `currentRepoOwner`, `currentRepoName`, etc., remain `undefined`.

2.  **Button Click: "Start Run"**
    *   **Log:** `ON MESSAGE RECEIVED: { type: 'command', command: 'startContinuousRun' }` - Correct.
    *   **Log:** `Processing command: startContinuousRun` - Correct.
    *   **Log:** `[continueInfer] Cycle start. Active: true. Payload: {"reason":"initial start"}` - Correct.
    *   **Log:** `[continueInfer STATE CHECK] Owner: undefined, Repo: undefined, Active: true` - **Confirms state is missing repo context.**
    *   **Log:** `[planNextExplorationStep] Deciding next step...`
    *   **Log:** `[planNextExplorationStep] Repository context (owner/name) not set...` - **Correct check fires.**
    *   **Log:** Observation added: "Please set the repository context..."
    *   **Log:** `stopContinuousRun` is called internally by the planner check.
    *   **Log:** `[continueInfer] No further exploration steps planned for now.` - Planner returned `null`.
    *   **Log:** `[continueInfer] Rescheduling planning cycle in 120 seconds.` - **Problem:** The loop *still reschedules itself* even though the planner returned `null` and `stopContinuousRun` was called.

3.  **Alarm @ 11:59:08 AM (`continueInfer` Cycle 2):**
    *   **Log:** `[continueInfer] Cycle start. Active: false. Payload: {"reason":"next planning cycle"}` - State check shows `Active: false` because `stopContinuousRun` was called previously.
    *   **Log:** `[continueInfer] Run inactive. Stopping.` - The loop correctly terminates here.

**Root Causes:**

1.  **LLM Not Using `setRepositoryContext` Tool:** Despite the system prompt and intent detection, the main LLM in `infer` is still not reliably choosing to use the `setRepositoryContext` tool when requested via natural language. It opts to generate text instead.
2.  **`continueInfer` Reschedules Unconditionally:** The rescheduling logic `await this.schedule(planningIntervalSeconds, 'continueInfer', ...)` happens *regardless* of whether `planNextExplorationStep` returned a valid action or `null`. It should only reschedule if the run is meant to continue *and* planning was successful (or maybe even only if an action was successfully scheduled).

**Instructions for Agent:**

"We have two remaining issues:

1.  The LLM is still not reliably using the `setRepositoryContext` tool when asked via message. It understands the intent but generates text instead of calling the tool.
2.  The `continueInfer` method reschedules the next planning cycle even if the current planning step failed (e.g., due to missing repo context) and `stopContinuousRun` was called internally.

Let's address these:

1.  **Force `setRepositoryContext` Tool Usage:** Since directly prompting the LLM isn't reliable for this specific setup action, let's modify the intent detection in `infer` to *directly call* the tool's execution logic when the intent is detected, bypassing the LLM's tool choice for this specific case."
    *   "In `src/server.ts`, find the `[Intent Check]` block within `infer`. Modify the `else if` block that detects 'set repo context':"

    ```typescript
            // Inside the `if (lastMessage && lastMessage.role === 'user')` block in `infer`

            // ... (Check for 'start continuous run') ...
            // ... (Check for 'stop continuous run') ...

            // *** MODIFY THIS BLOCK ***
            else if (lastUserMessageContent.toLowerCase().includes('set repo context') ||
                     lastUserMessageContent.toLowerCase().includes('set repository context')) {
              console.log("[Intent Check] User message requests setting repository context.");

              // --- BEGIN DIRECT TOOL EXECUTION LOGIC ---
              // Attempt to parse owner/repo/branch directly from the message (heuristic)
              // This is brittle, but necessary if the LLM won't use the tool.
              const match = lastUserMessageContent.match(/set.*?context\s+to\s+([\w-]+)\/([\w-]+)(?:\s+(\S+))?/i);
              if (match) {
                const owner = match[1];
                const repo = match[2];
                const branch = match[3] || 'main'; // Default to main if not specified
                console.log(`[Intent Check] Parsed context: ${owner}/${repo}:${branch}. Calling setRepositoryContext directly.`);
                try {
                  // Directly call the instance method, don't wait for LLM tool call
                   await this.setRepositoryContext(owner, repo, branch);
                   // Since we are bypassing the normal LLM response flow for this,
                   // we might need to manually create the assistant response here.
                   // For now, let's just return early. A better solution might involve
                   // adding a confirmation message to the state here.
                   this.addAgentObservation(`Repository context set via direct intent parsing: ${owner}/${repo}:${branch}`);
                   // We could potentially construct a simple text response here if needed.
                   // Example:
                   // messageParts.push({ type: 'text', text: `Okay, context set to ${owner}/${repo}:${branch}.` });
                   // But for now, let's just ensure the state is set and stop this infer cycle.
                   return {}; // Stop further processing in this infer cycle
                } catch (e) {
                   console.error("Error directly calling setRepositoryContext:", e);
                   this.addAgentObservation(`Error setting context: ${e.message}`);
                   // Allow infer to continue to generate an error message potentially
                }
              } else {
                console.warn("[Intent Check] Could not parse owner/repo/branch from message. Letting LLM handle it (might suggest tool).");
                // Let the LLM generate a response, hopefully suggesting the tool.
              }
              // --- END DIRECT TOOL EXECUTION LOGIC ---

            }
            // ONLY check for task generation if it wasn't a special command
            else {
              // ... (existing task generation logic) ...
            }
            // ...
    ```
    *   "Also, make the `setRepositoryContext` method on the `Coder` class `public` instead of relying on `@unstable_callable` (which should be removed) or the tool definition in `tools.ts` for this direct call."
        ```typescript
          // In Coder class definition:
          // @unstable_callable({...}) // REMOVE this decorator
          public async setRepositoryContext(owner: string, repo: string, branch: string = 'main') { // Make public
             console.log(`Setting repository context to ${owner}/${repo} on branch ${branch}`);
             this.updateState({ /* ... */ });
             // Return value isn't used by direct call, but keep for potential tool usage
             return { success: true, message: `Context set to ${owner}/${repo}:${branch}` };
          }
        ```
    *   *(Self-correction: Keep the tool definition in `tools.ts` as a fallback in case the direct parsing fails and the LLM *does* choose the tool, but prioritize the direct call via intent detection).*

2.  **Fix `continueInfer` Rescheduling Logic:** Modify `continueInfer` to only reschedule the next planning cycle *if* `planNextExplorationStep` returned a valid action *and* the run wasn't stopped within the planner."
    *   "In `src/server.ts`, modify the end of the `try` block in `continueInfer`:"

    ```typescript
        // Inside the try block of continueInfer

        if (nextAction) {
          // ... (schedule the specific action: scheduledListFiles or scheduledSummarizeFile) ...
          this.addAgentObservation(/* ... */);

          // *** MOVE RESCHEDULING HERE ***
          // Only reschedule the planner if an action was successfully planned *and* the run is still active
          if (this.state.isContinuousRunActive) {
              const planningIntervalSeconds = 120;
              console.log(`[continueInfer] Action scheduled. Rescheduling planning cycle in ${planningIntervalSeconds} seconds.`);
              await this.schedule(planningIntervalSeconds, 'continueInfer', { reason: 'next planning cycle' });
          } else {
               console.log(`[continueInfer] Run was stopped during planning/scheduling. Not rescheduling planning cycle.`);
          }

        } else {
          console.log("[continueInfer] No further exploration steps planned. Run potentially stopped or finished.");
          // Do NOT reschedule the planning cycle if no action could be planned (e.g., missing context caused stop)
          this.addAgentObservation("No specific exploration step found. Stopping or waiting for manual restart/context.");
          // Ensure the run is marked inactive if the planner decided to stop it.
          if(this.state.isContinuousRunActive) {
             // This case happens if planner returns null but stopContinuousRun wasn't explicitly called by planner
             // Maybe the exploration is just complete? Or stuck? For now, stop it.
             console.log("[continueInfer] Planner returned null, stopping continuous run.");
             await this.stopContinuousRun();
          }
        }
        // *** REMOVE THE RESCHEDULING FROM OUTSIDE THE if(nextAction) BLOCK ***
        // const planningIntervalSeconds = 120;
        // console.log(`[continueInfer] Rescheduling planning cycle in ${planningIntervalSeconds} seconds.`);
        // await this.schedule(planningIntervalSeconds, 'continueInfer', { reason: 'next planning cycle' });

      } catch (error) {
         // ... existing error handling ...
      }
    ```

**Explanation:**

*   **Direct Context Setting:** We add basic parsing to `infer` to directly extract owner/repo/branch when the user asks to set context. If successful, it calls `this.setRepositoryContext` immediately and bypasses letting the LLM respond (which was failing). This makes setting context more reliable. The tool definition remains as a fallback.
*   **Conditional Rescheduling:** `continueInfer` now only schedules the *next planning cycle* if the current planning cycle (`planNextExplorationStep`) successfully identified and scheduled an action *and* if the `isContinuousRunActive` flag wasn't turned off during planning (e.g., by the missing context check). If the planner returns `null`, the continuous loop effectively stops rescheduling itself.

Apply these changes. Test the workflow again: 1. Set context via message. 2. Start run via button. Observe logs and state."
