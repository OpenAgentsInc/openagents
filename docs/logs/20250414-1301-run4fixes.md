# Run 4 Fixes Implementation Report

## Overview

This report documents the implementation of fixes for two critical issues in the continuous run feature:

1. **Repository Context Setting Issue**: The LLM was not reliably using the `setRepositoryContext` tool when asked via message, instead generating text responses without actually setting the context.

2. **Continuous Run Rescheduling Logic Issue**: The `continueInfer` method was unconditionally rescheduling the next planning cycle even if the current planning cycle failed (e.g., due to missing repo context) and `stopContinuousRun` was called internally.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Direct Repository Context Setting

To address the unreliable LLM tool usage for setting repository context, I implemented direct parsing and execution logic in the `infer` method:

```typescript
// In server.ts, inside the infer method's intent check section:
else if (lastUserMessageContent.toLowerCase().includes('set repo context') ||
         lastUserMessageContent.toLowerCase().includes('set repository context')) {
  console.log("[Intent Check] User message requests setting repository context.");

  // Attempt to parse owner/repo/branch directly from the message (heuristic)
  const match = lastUserMessageContent.match(/set.*?context\s+to\s+([\w-]+)\/([\w-]+)(?:\s+(\S+))?/i);
  if (match) {
    const owner = match[1];
    const repo = match[2];
    const branch = match[3] || 'main'; // Default to main if not specified
    console.log(`[Intent Check] Parsed context: ${owner}/${repo}:${branch}. Calling setRepositoryContext directly.`);
    try {
      // Directly call the instance method, don't wait for LLM tool call
      await this.setRepositoryContext(owner, repo, branch);
      this.addAgentObservation(`Repository context set via direct intent parsing: ${owner}/${repo}:${branch}`);
      return {}; // Stop further processing in this infer cycle
    } catch (e) {
      console.error("Error directly calling setRepositoryContext:", e);
      this.addAgentObservation(`Error setting context: ${e.message}`);
      // Allow infer to continue to generate an error message potentially
    }
  } else {
    console.warn("[Intent Check] Could not parse owner/repo/branch from message. Letting LLM handle it (might suggest tool).");
    // Let the LLM generate a response, hopefully suggesting the tool.
  }
}
```

Additionally, I made the `setRepositoryContext` method `public` and removed the `@unstable_callable` decorator:

```typescript
/**
 * Sets the current repository context
 */
public async setRepositoryContext(owner: string, repo: string, branch: string = 'main') {
  console.log(`Setting repository context to ${owner}/${repo} on branch ${branch}`);

  this.updateState({
    currentRepoOwner: owner,
    currentRepoName: repo,
    currentBranch: branch,
  });

  return { success: true, message: `Context set to ${owner}/${repo}:${branch}` };
}
```

### 2. Conditional Rescheduling in continueInfer

To fix the unconditional rescheduling issue, I moved the rescheduling logic inside the `if (nextAction)` branch and added additional checks:

```typescript
if (nextAction) {
  // ... schedule the specific action ...
  
  // Only reschedule the planner if an action was successfully planned *and* the run is still active
  if (this.state.isContinuousRunActive) {
    const planningIntervalSeconds = 120;
    console.log(`[continueInfer] Action scheduled. Rescheduling planning cycle in ${planningIntervalSeconds} seconds.`);
    await this.schedule(planningIntervalSeconds, 'continueInfer', { reason: 'next planning cycle' });
  } else {
    console.log(`[continueInfer] Run was stopped during planning/scheduling. Not rescheduling planning cycle.`);
  }
} else {
  console.log("[continueInfer] No further exploration steps planned. Run potentially stopped or finished.");
  // Do NOT reschedule the planning cycle if no action could be planned
  // Ensure the run is marked inactive if the planner decided to stop it.
  if (this.state.isContinuousRunActive) {
    // This case happens if planner returns null but stopContinuousRun wasn't explicitly called by planner
    console.log("[continueInfer] Planner returned null, stopping continuous run.");
    await this.stopContinuousRun();
  }
}
// Removed the unconditional rescheduling that was here before
```

## Expected Behavior Improvements

1. **Repository Context Setting**: 
   - When a user asks to "set repo context to owner/repo", the system will now directly parse the owner and repo from the message and call `setRepositoryContext` without relying on the LLM to use the tool.
   - The LLM tool definition is still available as a fallback when direct parsing fails.

2. **Continuous Run Behavior**:
   - The continuous run now only reschedules itself when an action was successfully planned AND the run is still active.
   - If planning returns `null` (no action), the run is now automatically stopped rather than continuing to reschedule itself.
   - This eliminates the issue where the run would continue even after `stopContinuousRun` was called internally.

## Testing Procedure

To test these changes:

1. Send a message: "Set repo context to openagentsinc/openagents"
   - Verify logs show the direct parsing occurred
   - Verify state shows the correct owner/repo

2. Start a continuous run via button or message
   - Verify it schedules actions while repository context is set
   - Verify it stops if repository context is missing or cleared

## Further Improvements

While these changes address the immediate issues, some potential future improvements include:

1. Providing a proper response confirmation when direct repository context setting occurs
2. Adding more robust regexp patterns for parsing various formats of "set repo context" requests
3. Adding telemetry to track how often direct parsing succeeds vs. falls back to LLM tool usage
