Okay, let's diagnose this. The agent successfully started the continuous run, planned the first step (list `/`), executed `scheduledListFiles` correctly (fetching the directory and updating the state), and rescheduled the next planning cycle. That's all working perfectly now!

The problem is **why no message appeared in the UI** after you sent the "Start a continuous run..." message.

**Analysis:**

1.  **Message 1: "Set repo context..."**
    *   `infer` runs.
    *   Intent detection for "set repo context" is triggered.
    *   The logic added in the previous step **attempts to directly call `this.setRepositoryContext(...)`**.
    *   It then explicitly **`return {};`** from the `infer` method immediately after attempting the direct call.
    *   **Result:** The `infer` method completes *without* ever calling `generateText`. Therefore, no assistant message is generated or added to the state/UI for this turn. However, the state *is* correctly updated by the direct call to `setRepositoryContext`.

2.  **Message 2: "Start a continuous run..."**
    *   `onMessage` receives it, updates token (if needed), calls `infer`.
    *   `infer` runs.
    *   Intent detection correctly identifies "start continuous run".
    *   It calls `this.startContinuousRun()` in the background (`.catch()` means it doesn't wait).
    *   It then explicitly **`return {};`** from the `infer` method immediately after detecting the "start run" intent.
    *   **Result:** Again, the `infer` method completes *without* calling `generateText`. No assistant message is generated for this turn either, even though the continuous run was successfully started in the background (as confirmed by the logs and state update showing `isContinuousRunActive: true` and the first `continueInfer` cycle kicking off).

**Root Cause:**

The logic added to `infer` for handling the "start continuous run" and "set repo context" intents using direct method calls includes an early `return {};`. This prevents the `generateText` call at the end of `infer` from ever happening for those specific user messages.

While this correctly performs the *action* (setting context or starting the run), it sacrifices providing a textual confirmation back to the user in the chat UI for that turn.

**Fix / Instructions for Agent:**

"The agent is now correctly setting context and starting the continuous run based on user messages, and the continuous loop itself is working! The final issue is that the user isn't getting a confirmation message in the chat when they ask to set context or start the run.

**Problem:** The intent detection logic added in the `infer` method for 'set repo context' and 'start continuous run' uses `return {};` immediately after initiating the action. This prevents the rest of `infer` (including the call to `generateText`) from running, so no assistant text message is generated for that turn.

**Solution:** Remove the early `return {};` from the intent detection blocks and allow the `infer` method to proceed to `generateText`. The LLM should then generate an appropriate confirmation message based on the action taken and the updated state/observations.

1.  **Modify Intent Detection in `infer`:**
    *   In `src/server.ts`, find the `[Intent Check]` block inside `infer`.
    *   **Remove** the `return {};` line from the block handling `start continuous run`.
    *   **Remove** the `return {};` line from the `try` block that directly calls `setRepositoryContext` (within the 'set repo context' detection block).
    *   Ensure the `else if` for 'stop continuous run' also doesn't have an early return (it shouldn't based on previous code).

        commandIntentDetected = true;

        this.startContinuousRun().catch(e => console.error(/*...*/));
        this.addAgentObservation("Continuous run initiated by user message."); // Add observation

        // No return here is correct - let infer continue

    else if (lastUserMessageContent.toLowerCase().includes('set repo context') || /*...*/) {
        commandIntentDetected = true; // Treat as command intent

        const match = lastUserMessageContent.match(/set.*?context\s+to\s+([\w-]+)\/([\w-]+)(?:\s+(\S+))?/i);

            const owner = match[1]; // ... etc ...

            try {
                await this.setRepositoryContext(owner, repo, branch);
