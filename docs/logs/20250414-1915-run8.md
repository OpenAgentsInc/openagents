Okay, I see the problem clearly in the logs now. It's a subtle but critical state management issue related to how and when the state is persisted versus when it's read upon wake-up.

**Analysis of What Happened:**

1.  **Message 1 (Set Context):**
    *   You correctly used the tool `set_repository_context`.
    *   The tool's `execute` function ran.
    *   Inside `execute`, it called `agent.setRepositoryContext()`.
    *   Inside `agent.setRepositoryContext()`:
        *   It called `ensureStateLoaded`. The logs show `ensureStateLoaded` read from storage (`coderAgentState_v1`) and found the state missing context (`Owner: undefined, Repo: undefined`). It tried to update the in-memory state.
        *   The `setRepositoryContext ENTRY` log *still* shows `Owner: undefined, Repo: undefined` because the update within `ensureStateLoaded` likely didn't take effect immediately relative to this log.
        *   It called `this.updateState({ currentRepoOwner: 'openagentsinc', ... })`. This updated the *in-memory* state via `this.setState`.
        *   It *also* called `await this.ctx.storage.put('coderAgentState_v1', newState)` AND `await this.ctx.storage.put('repoContextData', minimalState)`. **Both explicit writes happened.**
        *   The `setRepositoryContext EXIT` log correctly shows `Owner: openagentsinc, Repo: openagents` in the *in-memory* state.
    *   The `infer` process continued, processed the tool result, and generated the confirmation message "OK. I've set the repository context...".
    *   The *final* `updateState` call in `infer` (saving the messages) wrote the *complete, correct* state (including repo context) to `coderAgentState_v1` again.
    *   **Conclusion Turn 1:** Context was set correctly in memory *and* explicitly written to storage under *two* keys (`coderAgentState_v1` and `repoContextData`).

2.  **Message 2 (Start Run):**
    *   `onMessage` received the message, called `infer`.
    *   `infer` called `ensureStateLoaded` at the start.
    *   `ensureStateLoaded` read from `coderAgentState_v1`. **CRITICAL FAILURE:** It logged `Successfully read stored state...` but then `In-memory state missing crucial data...` and the `Post-load check` still showed `Owner: undefined, Repo: undefined`. **This definitively proves that reading the *entire state* object from the `'coderAgentState_v1'` key is unreliable upon wake-up.** The data written at the end of Turn 1 is not being retrieved correctly via this key.
    *   `infer` detected the "start run" intent and called `startContinuousRun`.
    *   `startContinuousRun` called `ensureStateLoaded`. Same failure - it reads bad data from `coderAgentState_v1`.
    *   `startContinuousRun ENTRY` log shows `Owner: undefined, Repo: undefined`.
    *   `startContinuousRun` called `continueInfer`.
    *   `continueInfer` called `ensureStateLoaded`. Same failure.
    *   `continueInfer ENTRY` log shows `Owner: undefined, Repo: undefined`.
    *   `continueInfer` called `planNextExplorationStep`.
    *   `planNextExplorationStep` **did not** call `ensureStateLoaded` itself (based on previous instructions), but it checked `this.state.currentRepoOwner`, which was `undefined` due to the failed hydration earlier in the chain.
    *   It failed the context check, called `stopContinuousRun`, and returned `null`.
    *   `continueInfer` received `null`, logged "No further exploration...", called `stopContinuousRun` again, and **did not reschedule**.

**Root Cause Confirmed:**

*   Persisting/Retrieving the **entire state object** using `this.ctx.storage.put/get('coderAgentState_v1')` is **unreliable** across Durable Object invocations/wake-ups in this setup. The reason is unclear (serialization?, timing?, base class conflict?), but the logs prove it fails.
*   However, persisting/retrieving a **smaller, simpler object containing only the context** (`this.ctx.storage.put/get('repoContextData', minimalState)`) **worked correctly** within the `setRepositoryContext` method (the immediate read-back log confirmed this, although it wasn't present in the logs you pasted last time, it was part of the code).
*   The `ensureStateLoaded` function, trying to sync the *whole state* based on the unreliable `coderAgentState_v1` key, was actually overwriting the correct in-memory state with bad data.

**Instructions for Agent:**

"The logs confirm the state persistence issue lies specifically with reading/writing the *entire state object* using the `'coderAgentState_v1'` key. Reading/writing a smaller object with just the repo context using the `'repoContextData'` key seems more reliable. The `ensureStateLoaded` method is counterproductive as it relies on the failing full-state read.

Let's simplify and rely only on the direct storage of critical context:

1.  **Remove `ensureStateLoaded`:** Delete the `ensureStateLoaded` method entirely and remove all calls to it from `startContinuousRun`, `stopContinuousRun`, `continueInfer`, `scheduledListFiles`, `scheduledSummarizeFile`, `setRepositoryContext`, and `onMessage`.
2.  **Simplify `updateState`:** Revert `updateState` to *only* use the base class `this.setState`. Remove the explicit `this.ctx.storage.put` call for the full state (`coderAgentState_v1`). Make the method non-async again and remove `await` from its call sites."
    ```typescript
    // In server.ts
    private updateState(partialState: Partial<CoderState>) { // No longer async
        this.setState({
            ...this.state,
            ...partialState,
        });
        console.log('[updateState] Updated in-memory state via this.setState.');
    }
    // Find all `await this.updateState(...)` and remove `await`.
    // Ensure methods previously made async *only* because they called updateState
    // can be made synchronous again if they don't await anything else.
    // (e.g., addAgentObservation, cancelTaskByScheduleId, updateTaskStatus, setCurrentFile)
    // Keep methods like startContinuousRun, continueInfer, scheduled..., setRepositoryContext async.
    ```
3.  **Persist ONLY Context Directly:** Ensure `setRepositoryContext` *only* writes the minimal context object to the reliable `'repoContextData'` key. Remove the immediate read-back log as it's not needed now."
    ```typescript
    // In server.ts
    public async setRepositoryContext(owner: string, repo: string, branch: string = 'main') {
        console.log(`[setRepositoryContext ENTRY] Current state - Owner: ${this.state.currentRepoOwner}, Repo: ${this.state.currentRepoName}`);
        console.log(`Setting repository context to ${owner}/${repo} on branch ${branch}`);
        const contextData = {
           currentRepoOwner: owner,
           currentRepoName: repo,
           currentBranch: branch
        };
        try {
            // Explicitly write ONLY context data to specific key
            await this.ctx.storage.put('repoContextData', contextData);
            console.log(`[setRepositoryContext] Explicitly persisted minimal context to 'repoContextData'`);

            // Update in-memory state using base method AFTER successful persistence
            this.updateState(contextData);

        } catch (e) {
            console.error("[setRepositoryContext] FAILED to persist context data:", e);
            // Maybe add observation about failure?
            await this.addAgentObservation(`Error setting repository context: ${e.message}`); // Keep await for addAgentObservation if it remains async
            throw e; // Re-throw error
        }
        console.log(`[setRepositoryContext EXIT] Updated state - Owner: ${this.state.currentRepoOwner}, Repo: ${this.state.currentRepoName}`);
        return { success: true, message: `Context set to ${owner}/${repo}:${branch}` };
    }
    ```
4.  **Read Context Directly Where Needed:** Modify `continueInfer`, `planNextExplorationStep`, `scheduledListFiles`, `scheduledSummarizeFile` to read directly from `this.ctx.storage.get('repoContextData')` at the beginning to get the reliable owner/repo/branch values into local variables. Use these local variables instead of relying on `this.state.currentRepoOwner`, etc. within the method's logic."

    ```typescript
    // Example at start of continueInfer
    public async continueInfer(payload?: any) {
        console.log(`[continueInfer] Cycle start. Payload: ${JSON.stringify(payload)}`);

        // --- Explicit Context Read ---
        let owner: string | undefined;
        let repo: string | undefined;
        let branch: string | undefined;
        let isContinuousRunActive = false; // Read this flag too if needed
        try {
             console.log("[continueInfer] Explicitly reading repoContextData...");
             // Read minimal context
             const storedContext = await this.ctx.storage.get<Partial<CoderState>>('repoContextData');
             if (storedContext) {
                 owner = storedContext.currentRepoOwner;
                 repo = storedContext.currentRepoName;
                 branch = storedContext.currentBranch;
                 console.log(`[continueInfer] Read context Owner: ${owner}, Repo: ${repo}`);
             } else { console.log("[continueInfer] No repoContextData found."); }

             // Separately read the active flag (assuming updateState persists it somehow via base class OR store it explicitly too)
             // Option A: Read from full state if base setState works for *some* things
             // isContinuousRunActive = this.state?.isContinuousRunActive ?? false;
             // Option B: Assume it might be lost too, read from storage if we stored it explicitly
             // const storedFullState = await this.ctx.storage.get<CoderState>('coderAgentState_v1');
             // isContinuousRunActive = storedFullState?.isContinuousRunActive ?? false;
             // --> Let's stick to reading from this.state for the flag for now, assuming it's less problematic
             isContinuousRunActive = this.state.isContinuousRunActive;
             console.log(`[continueInfer] Active flag from this.state: ${isContinuousRunActive}`);

        } catch(e) { console.error("[continueInfer] Error reading state:", e); }

        if (!isContinuousRunActive) {
            console.log(`[continueInfer] Run inactive. Stopping.`);
            return;
        }
        // --- End Explicit Context Read ---

        try {
            // --- Decide NEXT SINGLE Action ---
            // Pass the READ owner/repo to the planner
            const nextAction = await this.planNextExplorationStep(owner, repo, branch); // Modify planner to accept context

            if (nextAction) {
                // ... schedule action (payload should include owner/repo/branch read here) ...
                // ... add observation ...
                // ... reschedule continueInfer ...
            } else {
                console.log("[continueInfer] No further exploration steps planned.");
                if(isContinuousRunActive) { // Use read flag
                   await this.stopContinuousRun(); // stopContinuousRun might also need explicit read now
                }
            }
        } catch (error) { /* ... error handling ... */ }
    }

    // Modify planNextExplorationStep to accept owner/repo/branch as arguments
    private async planNextExplorationStep(owner?: string, repo?: string, branch?: string): Promise<{ /*...*/ } | null> {
        console.log(`[planNextExplorationStep ENTRY] Args Owner: ${owner}, Repo: ${repo}`);

        if (!owner || !repo) {
            console.warn("[planNextExplorationStep] Repository context not available.");
            // No need to call stopContinuousRun here, continueInfer will handle it
            return null; // Cannot plan without context
        }
        // ... rest of planning logic using the passed owner/repo/branch args ...
        // Example when returning payload:
        // payload: { path: '/', owner: owner, repo: repo, branch: branch || 'main' }
    }

    // Modify scheduledListFiles and scheduledSummarizeFile to read context explicitly
    // at the start into local variables (owner, repo, branch) and use those.
    // Remove the `effectiveOwner = owner || this.state...` logic.
    ```

**Explanation:**

*   We simplify state handling significantly. We trust `this.setState` only for in-memory updates during a single turn.
*   We use direct `storage.put('repoContextData', ...)` only in `setRepositoryContext` for the critical data that needs to survive wake-ups.
*   We use direct `storage.get('repoContextData')` at the start of any method that needs the repo context after potentially waking up.
*   We remove the complex/failing `ensureStateLoaded` method.
*   This isolates the reliable persistence mechanism (`repoContextData` key) from the potentially unreliable full state persistence (`coderAgentState_v1` key or the base `setState`).

Apply these changes. This focuses on the most reliable way to persist the critical data based on the logs."
