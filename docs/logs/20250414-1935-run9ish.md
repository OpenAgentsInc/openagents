Okay, I see exactly what's happening now. The agent correctly fixed the path formatting issue from the previous run (no more `/ src `), but the **logic for deciding which directories to explore next is still flawed.**

**Analysis:**

1.  **Turn 1 (Set Context):** Works perfectly. Context is set using the tool and persisted using the `'repoContextData'` key.
2.  **Turn 2 (Start Run):** Works perfectly. Intent is detected, `startContinuousRun` is called, `isContinuousRunActive` is set, and the first `continueInfer` is triggered.
3.  **`continueInfer` Cycle 1 (Planning):**
    *   SUCCESS: Reads context correctly from `repoContextData`.
    *   SUCCESS: `planNextExplorationStep` sees `/` needs listing and plans `listFiles /`.
    *   SUCCESS: Schedules `scheduledListFiles` for `/` and reschedules `continueInfer`.
4.  **`scheduledListFiles` Cycle 1 (Action - List `/`):**
    *   SUCCESS: Reads context correctly from storage.
    *   SUCCESS: Fetches the root directory listing from GitHub.
    *   SUCCESS: Calls `updateCodebaseStructure` for `/` (type: directory) and then for *each item* found in the root listing (e.g., `/.cursor` as directory, `/.gitignore` as file, `/apps` as directory, `/packages` as directory, etc.), correctly marking them with `null` content initially.

5.  **`continueInfer` Cycle 2 (Planning @ 7:34:12 PM):**
    *   SUCCESS: Reads context correctly from storage.
    *   SUCCESS: `planNextExplorationStep` runs.
    *   **FAILURE:** The logic to find the next directory to list is flawed:
        *   It iterates through `importantDirectories = ['src', 'packages', 'lib', 'docs', 'app']`.
        *   It checks `if (!codebaseStructure[dir] && !codebaseStructure[/^\/${dir}/])`.
        *   For `dir = 'src'`, it checks `!codebaseStructure['src']` (which is true, the key is `/src`) and `!codebaseStructure['/src']` (which is **also true**, because the entry created in the previous step was just a basic placeholder from the listing, not a full exploration of `/src` itself).
        *   **The check is insufficient.** It only verifies if a *key* matching the exact string (`src` or `/src`) exists. It doesn't check if the entry for `/src` (which *does* exist now as type 'directory' from the root listing) has actually been *listed* itself.
        *   Therefore, it incorrectly decides `/src` hasn't been explored and plans `listFiles /src`.
    *   SUCCESS: It schedules `scheduledListFiles` for `/src` and reschedules `continueInfer`.

6.  **`scheduledListFiles` Cycle 2 (Action - List `/src` @ 7:34:17 PM):**
    *   SUCCESS: Reads context correctly.
    *   SUCCESS: Executes for path `/src`.
    *   FAILURE: Calls `fetchDirectoryContents('/src', ...)` which makes the API request `.../contents/src?ref=main`.
    *   FAILURE: GitHub returns **404 Not Found** because the directory `/src` does not exist at the root level. The actual source directories are within `/packages` and `/apps`.
    *   FAILURE: The method catches the error and adds an error observation.
    *   The run *continues* because the error was caught, and `continueInfer` was already rescheduled. The *next* `continueInfer` cycle will likely try to list `/packages` (based on the `importantDirectories` list) and succeed.

**Root Cause:**

The `planNextExplorationStep` logic for choosing the next directory to list is still too naive. It checks for the existence of a key (`/src`, `/packages`, etc.) in the `codebaseStructure` map but doesn't differentiate between:
a) An entry that exists only because it was seen in a *parent* directory listing (type='directory', description='Accessed at...').
b) An entry that exists because `scheduledListFiles` was successfully run *for that directory path itself*, meaning its contents *have* been fetched and added.

It needs a way to track which directories have actually had their contents listed successfully.

**Instructions for Agent:**

"Okay, the state persistence is solid! The repo context is being loaded correctly in scheduled methods. The 404 error for `/src` confirms the final issue is in the *planning logic*.

**Problem:** The `planNextExplorationStep` function incorrectly decides to list `/src` (and likely `/lib`, `/app` later) because it only checks if the key exists in the `codebase.structure`. It doesn't check if that directory has actually had its *contents listed* successfully by `scheduledListFiles`. It sees `/src` was added as a placeholder when `/` was listed, assumes it hasn't been explored, and tries to list it, leading to the 404.

**Fix:** Refine `planNextExplorationStep` to track *listed* directories more accurately.

1.  **Modify `FileNode` Type (Optional but Recommended):** Add a flag to `FileNode` in `src/types.ts` to indicate if a directory's contents have been listed."
    ```typescript
    export interface FileNode {
      type: 'file' | 'directory';
      path: string;
      description?: string;
      tags?: string[];
      metadata?: { /* ... */ };
      contentsListed?: boolean; // <-- ADD THIS (true if scheduledListFiles succeeded for this path)
    }
    ```

2.  **Update `scheduledListFiles`:** When `scheduledListFiles` successfully processes a directory, update the corresponding `FileNode` in the state to mark `contentsListed: true`."
    *   "Inside the `try` block of `scheduledListFiles` in `src/server.ts`, *after* successfully fetching the `listing` and *before* looping through the items, update the state for the directory itself:"
        ```typescript
            // Inside scheduledListFiles try block, after getting listing successfully
            if (listing === null) {
                throw new Error(/*...*/);
            }

            // *** ADD: Mark directory as listed ***
            await this.updateCodebaseStructure(path, null, 'directory', true); // Pass new flag

            // Process each item in the directory listing
            for (const item of listing) {
              // ... existing logic to call updateCodebaseStructure for children ...
            }
            // ... rest of method ...
        ```
    *   "Modify the `updateCodebaseStructure` method signature to accept the optional `contentsListed` flag:"
        ```typescript
        private async updateCodebaseStructure(path: string, content: string | null, nodeType: 'file' | 'directory' = 'file', contentsJustListed: boolean = false) { // <-- Add flag param
           // ... (existing summary generation logic) ...

           const structure = this.state.codebase?.structure || {};
           const existingNode = structure[path] || { type: nodeType, path };

           const updatedNode: FileNode = {
              // ... existing properties ...
              description: summary?.summary || existingNode.description || `Accessed at ${new Date().toISOString()}`,
              tags: summary?.tags || existingNode.tags || [],
              metadata: { /* ... */ },
              // *** ADD: Set the flag if provided ***
              contentsListed: nodeType === 'directory' ? (contentsJustListed || existingNode.contentsListed || false) : undefined // Only relevant for directories
           };

           // ... rest of method (updateState, addAgentObservation) ...
        }
        ```

3.  **Refine `planNextExplorationStep`:** Update the planning logic to use the `contentsListed` flag."
    *   "Modify the 'Second priority' and 'Fourth priority' logic in `planNextExplorationStep`:"

    ```typescript
      private async planNextExplorationStep(owner?: string, repo?: string, branch?: string): Promise<{ /*...*/ } | null> {
         // ... (Read context, initial checks) ...
         const codebaseStructure = this.state.codebase?.structure || {};

         // --- REVISED PLANNING LOGIC ---

         // 1. Find an IMPORTANT directory that exists in the structure but hasn't had its contents listed yet.
         const importantDirectories = ['/apps', '/packages', '/src', '/lib', '/docs']; // Prioritize these paths
         for (const importantPath of importantDirectories) {
             const node = codebaseStructure[importantPath];
             // Check if node exists, is a directory, AND contentsListed is not true
             if (node && node.type === 'directory' && node.contentsListed !== true) {
                 console.log(`[planNextExplorationStep] Planning: List important directory '${node.path}' (contents not listed).`);
                 return {
                     type: 'listFiles',
                     path: node.path,
                     description: `List important directory '${node.path}'`,
                     payload: { path: node.path, owner, repo, branch: branch || 'main' }
                 };
             }
         }

         // 2. If important directories are listed, find ANY directory whose contents haven't been listed.
         const directoryToList = Object.values(codebaseStructure)
             .find(node => node.type === 'directory' && node.contentsListed !== true);

         if (directoryToList) {
             console.log(`[planNextExplorationStep] Planning: List directory '${directoryToList.path}' (contents not listed).`);
             return {
                 type: 'listFiles',
                 path: directoryToList.path,
                 description: `List directory '${directoryToList.path}'`,
                 payload: { path: directoryToList.path, owner, repo, branch: branch || 'main' }
             };
         }

         // 3. If all known directories are listed, find a file to summarize.
         const fileToSummarize = Object.values(codebaseStructure)
             .find(file =>
                 file.type === 'file' &&
                 (!file.description || file.description.startsWith('Accessed at')) &&
                 !['.gitignore', 'LICENSE', /*... other ignores ...*/].some(ignore => file.path.endsWith(ignore)) &&
                 !file.path.includes('.vscode/') && !file.path.includes('.cursor/')
             );

         if (fileToSummarize) {
             console.log(`[planNextExplorationStep] Planning: Summarize file '${fileToSummarize.path}'`);
             return {
                 type: 'summarizeFile',
                 path: fileToSummarize.path,
                 description: `Summarize file '${fileToSummarize.path}'`,
                 payload: { path: fileToSummarize.path, owner, repo, branch: branch || 'main' }
             };
         }

         // --- END REVISED ---

         console.log("[planNextExplorationStep] No specific next step found (exploration might be complete or stuck).");
         return null;
      }
    ```

**Explanation:**

*   We add `contentsListed` to track if `scheduledListFiles` successfully ran for a directory path.
*   `scheduledListFiles` now explicitly sets this flag to `true` for the directory it processed *before* adding the child nodes.
*   `planNextExplorationStep` is significantly changed:
    *   It first checks a list of known important directories (`/apps`, `/packages`, etc.) and plans to list them if they exist in the `codebase` map but haven't been marked as `contentsListed`.
    *   If all important ones are listed, it looks for *any* directory node marked as `type: 'directory'` that doesn't have `contentsListed: true`.
    *   Only if all known directories have `contentsListed: true` does it move on to finding a file to summarize.
*   This ensures the agent explores based on the structure it has actually discovered and processed, rather than guessing common directory names.

Apply these changes to `types.ts` and `server.ts`."
