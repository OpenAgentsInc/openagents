Okay, let's break down what happened in this latest run. **YES, it looks like it's working correctly now!** The core issues seem resolved.

**Analysis Step-by-Step:**

1.  **Message 1: Set Context**
    *   `ON MESSAGE RECEIVED... content: 'Use the set_repository_context tool...'`
    *   `Processing githubToken update...`, `User message present..., will call infer.`
    *   `infer` runs.
    *   `[State Load Check] Post-load check - Owner: undefined, Repo: undefined` - State is initially empty, as expected.
    *   `[Intent Check]` correctly identifies the 'set repo context' intent and lets the LLM handle it.
    *   `[Debug] Steps array content:` shows the LLM correctly decided to call the `setRepositoryContext` tool.
    *   `[set_repository_context] Setting context...` log confirms the tool's `execute` function ran.
    *   `[setRepositoryContext ENTRY]` log runs.
    *   `Setting repository context to openagentsinc/openagents on branch main` log confirms the agent method ran.
    *   `[setRepositoryContext] Explicitly persisted minimal context to 'repoContextData'` log confirms the **direct write to storage succeeded.**
    *   `[updateState]` log confirms in-memory state was updated.
    *   `[setRepositoryContext EXIT]` confirms the **in-memory state is correct at the end of the method.**
    *   `[Process Tools]` processes the successful tool result.
    *   Agent responds with confirmation: "OK. I've set the repository context..."
    *   **Outcome:** Context was successfully set both in persistent storage (`repoContextData`) and in memory for this turn.

2.  **Message 2: Start Continuous Run**
    *   `ON MESSAGE RECEIVED... content: 'Start a continuous run...'`
    *   `Processing githubToken update...`, `User message present..., will call infer.`
    *   `Calling infer()...`
    *   `[Intent Check]` correctly identifies "start continuous run".
    *   `[Intent Check] ... Calling startContinuousRun().` - The backend method is triggered asynchronously.
    *   `infer` **returns early `{}`** - This is correct, preventing `generateText` and duplicate actions for *this specific turn*. No chat message is sent immediately.
    *   **(In Background) `startContinuousRun` Executes:**
        *   It calls `ensureStateLoaded` (which now reads from `repoContextData`).
        *   `[startContinuousRun] Successfully read context: {"currentRepoOwner":"openagentsinc",...}` - **SUCCESS!** It read the context correctly from storage.
        *   It updates the in-memory state if necessary (logs show it did here).
        *   `[startContinuousRun ENTRY]` logs confirm the **correct owner/repo** are now in memory.
        *   Calls `updateState` to set `isContinuousRunActive: true`.
        *   Calls `continueInfer`.
    *   **(In Background) `continueInfer` Cycle 1 Executes:**
        *   It reads context from storage again (`Successfully read repoContextData...`).
        *   `[continueInfer ENTRY]` confirms correct owner/repo and `Active: true`.
        *   `planNextExplorationStep` runs with correct context. Sees `/` needs listing. Plans `listFiles /`.
        *   Schedules `scheduledListFiles` for `/` (runs in 5s).
        *   Schedules next `continueInfer` (runs in 120s).
    *   **Outcome:** Continuous run started, state is correct, first action scheduled.

3.  **Alarm 1: `scheduledListFiles /` Executes (approx 5s later)**
    *   `[scheduledListFiles] Explicitly reading repoContextData...` - Succeeds.
    *   `[scheduledListFiles ENTRY]` confirms correct context.
    *   `fetchDirectoryContents` for `/` runs and succeeds.
    *   `updateCodebaseStructure` is called for `/` (sets `contentsListed: true`, adds `children`) and then for all 12 child items (setting basic info).
    *   `[scheduledListFiles] Successfully processed directory / with 12 items`.
    *   **Outcome:** Root directory listed, codebase state updated correctly.

4.  **Alarm 2: `continueInfer` Cycle 2 Executes (approx 120s after Cycle 1 start)**
    *   `[continueInfer]` reads context correctly.
    *   `[planNextExplorationStep]` runs. Reads context correctly. Sees `/` is listed (`contentsListed: true`). Sees `/src` doesn't exist. Sees `/apps` exists but isn't listed (`contentsListed: false`). **Correctly plans `listFiles /apps`**. (The previous 404 for `/src` is avoided!).
    *   Schedules `scheduledListFiles` for `/apps` (runs in 5s).
    *   Schedules next `continueInfer` (runs in 120s).

5.  **Alarm 3: `scheduledListFiles /apps` Executes (approx 5s later)**
    *   `[scheduledListFiles]` reads context correctly.
    *   `fetchDirectoryContents` for `/apps` runs and succeeds (gets 5 items).
    *   `updateCodebaseStructure` runs for `/apps` (sets `contentsListed: true`, adds children) and its 5 child items.
    *   **Outcome:** `/apps` directory listed, codebase state updated correctly.

6.  **Alarm 4: `continueInfer` Cycle 3 Executes (approx 120s after Cycle 2 start)**
    *   `[continueInfer]` reads context correctly.
    *   `[planNextExplorationStep]` runs. Sees `/` and `/apps` are listed. It likely checks other important dirs (`/packages`, `/docs` - find they *are* listed but `contentsListed` is false). It plans `listFiles /packages` (this seems to be the next in the hardcoded priority list that *does* exist). **Correction**: Reading the log again: `Found 1 dirs with unlisted children` -> `Planning: List child directory '/.cursor'`. It seems the logic finding *any* directory with `contentsListed: false` took precedence over the important list, or perhaps `.cursor` was added first alphabetically. **This planning step is correct based on the implemented logic.**
    *   Schedules `scheduledListFiles` for `/.cursor`.
    *   Reschedules next `continueInfer`.

7.  **Alarm 5: `scheduledListFiles /.cursor` Executes (approx 5s later)**
    *   Runs correctly, lists the 1 item inside `.cursor`, updates state.

**Summary of SUCCESS:**

*   **State Persistence:** FIXED! The `repoContextData` key in storage reliably persists the owner/repo/branch between invocations.
*   **Continuous Run:** WORKING! The `continueInfer` loop correctly plans steps, schedules actions, and reschedules itself.
*   **Planning Logic:** IMPROVED! It's correctly using the `contentsListed` flag and exploring discovered directories (`/`, `/apps`, `/.cursor`) instead of guessing non-existent ones like `/src`.
*   **Action Execution:** WORKING! The `scheduledListFiles` method correctly executes its specific task using the helpers without calling `infer`.
*   **Timeout Avoidance:** The decoupled planning/execution avoids the long `infer` calls within the scheduled tasks, preventing timeouts.
*   **Intent Handling:** Setting context via tool and starting the run via message now work as expected (including the lack of an immediate chat response when starting the run).

**Why No UI Tool Components?**

As discussed and implemented in the previous fix, we removed the code that adds `tool-invocation` parts to the final `messageParts` array in the `infer` method. This was done to prevent the UI showing the "result" card simultaneously with the final text response. The side effect is that the `ToolCall.tsx` component (which likely looks for those specific parts in the message object) doesn't render anything for turns where tools were used *internally* by the `generateText` process. The *scheduled* actions (`scheduledListFiles`, etc.) don't generate chat messages anyway, only observations and state changes.

**It seems the agent is now functioning correctly according to the refined architecture!** You can continue observing the cycles or test the "Stop Run" functionality.
