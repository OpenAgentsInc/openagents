# PNPM Migration

This document logs the migration from Yarn to PNPM for package management in the OpenAgents monorepo.

## Changes Made

1. Added `pnpm-workspace.yaml` to define the workspace packages:
   ```yaml
   packages:
     - 'apps/*'
     - 'packages/*'
   ```

2. Updated package references to use the PNPM workspace protocol:
   - Changed all internal package references from `"*"` to `"workspace:*"` in:
     - `/apps/chatserver/package.json`
     - `/apps/coder/package.json`
     - `/apps/website/package.json`
     - `/apps/onyx/package.json`
     - `/packages/agents/package.json`

3. Updated scripts in root `package.json`:
   - Changed all `yarn workspace` commands to `pnpm --filter`
   - Changed `yarn workspaces run` to `pnpm -r run`

4. Updated `clean-install.sh` to use PNPM instead of Yarn

## Known Issues

- Some peer dependency warnings exist but are not related to PNPM specifically

## Usage

- Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
- Run commands on a specific package: `pnpm --filter @openagents/[package-name] [command]`
- Run a command on all packages: `pnpm -r run [command]`
- Clean and reinstall: `pnpm run clean`
