# UI Package Setup - December 4, 2025, 10:50 AM

## Objective

Set up the @openagentsinc/ui package following the monorepo conventions and create a reusable checklist for future package creation.

## Tasks
1. Analyze existing package structure and configurations
2. Create comprehensive package creation checklist
3. Set up packages/ui with proper configuration
4. Ensure workspace integration
5. Update GitHub issue #903 with progress

## Analysis Log

### 1. Examining Existing Package Patterns

Analyzed the existing packages and found:
- Standard package.json with Effect.js build configuration
- Multi-stage TypeScript compilation (src, test, build)
- Effect build-utils for codegen and packaging
- Vitest for testing with shared configuration
- Workspace dependencies using `workspace:^`

### 2. Created Package Creation Checklist

Created comprehensive documentation at `/docs/creating-new-packages.md` with:
- Step-by-step instructions
- Template files for all configurations
- Common issues and solutions
- Best practices

### 3. Setting Up UI Package

Successfully created the @openagentsinc/ui package:

#### Created Files:
- package.json with React/UI dependencies
- TypeScript configurations (tsconfig.*.json)
- vitest.config.ts with jsdom environment
- Initial directory structure (core/web separation)
- Sample Button component to test build
- Type definitions for pane system
- Utility functions (cn for className merging)

#### Key Decisions:
- Excluded .tsx files from Effect codegen (only .ts files)
- Added React 19 and Radix UI dependencies
- Configured for JSX with react-jsx transform
- Set up jsdom environment for React testing

#### Verified:
- Dependencies installed successfully
- Codegen works properly
- TypeScript compilation passes

### 4. Next Steps

Need to:
1. Add Tailwind CSS configuration
2. Create pane and hotbar components
3. Set up proper exports structure
4. Add tests
