# UI Package Setup - December 4, 2025, 10:50 AM

## Objective

Set up the @openagentsinc/ui package following the monorepo conventions and create a reusable checklist for future package creation.

## Tasks
1. Analyze existing package structure and configurations
2. Create comprehensive package creation checklist
3. Set up packages/ui with proper configuration
4. Ensure workspace integration
5. Update GitHub issue #903 with progress

## Analysis Log

### 1. Examining Existing Package Patterns

Analyzed the existing packages and found:
- Standard package.json with Effect build configuration
- Multi-stage TypeScript compilation (src, test, build)
- Effect build-utils for codegen and packaging
- Vitest for testing with shared configuration
- Workspace dependencies using `workspace:^`

### 2. Created Package Creation Checklist

Created comprehensive documentation at `/docs/creating-new-packages.md` with:
- Step-by-step instructions
- Template files for all configurations
- Common issues and solutions
- Best practices

### 3. Setting Up UI Package

Successfully created the @openagentsinc/ui package:

#### Created Files:
- package.json with React/UI dependencies
- TypeScript configurations (tsconfig.*.json)
- vitest.config.ts with jsdom environment
- Initial directory structure (core/web separation)
- Sample Button component to test build
- Type definitions for pane system
- Utility functions (cn for className merging)

#### Key Decisions:
- Excluded .tsx files from Effect codegen (only .ts files)
- Added React 19 and Radix UI dependencies
- Configured for JSX with react-jsx transform
- Set up jsdom environment for React testing

#### Verified:
- Dependencies installed successfully
- Codegen works properly
- TypeScript compilation passes

### 4. Completed Setup

Successfully completed initial UI package setup:
- ✅ Added Tailwind CSS v4 configuration
- ✅ Created proper export structure (core/web separation)
- ✅ Fixed all linting issues
- ✅ Added jsdom for React testing
- ✅ All pre-push checks pass
- ✅ Pushed to remote branch 'ui'
- ✅ Updated GitHub issue #903 with progress

### 5. Summary

The @openagentsinc/ui package is now ready for component extraction. Key achievements:

1. **Created comprehensive package creation guide** at `/docs/creating-new-packages.md`
2. **Set up modern React 19 + TypeScript environment** with proper JSX support
3. **Configured Tailwind CSS v4** with OKLCH colors and zero border radius
4. **Established platform abstraction pattern** with core/web separation
5. **Integrated with monorepo** build and test systems

All files follow the monorepo conventions and pass CI checks. The package is ready for the next phase of extracting components from Commander.

### 6. Stopping Point

This is a good stopping point. The foundation is complete and the next phase would involve:
- Extracting pane components from Commander
- Extracting hotbar components
- Setting up proper state management
- Creating comprehensive tests

Branch: `ui` is ready for review and further development.
