# Playground Package Setup - December 4, 2025, 11:10 AM

## Objective

Create a playground package using Vite to test the @openagentsinc/ui package components.

## Tasks
1. Create Vite React TypeScript project
2. Follow the package creation checklist to integrate with monorepo
3. Import and test UI components
4. Verify the UI package exports work correctly

## Progress Log

### 1. Creating Vite Project

Created Vite React TypeScript project successfully.

### 2. Following Package Creation Checklist

Successfully adapted the Vite project to monorepo conventions:
- ✅ Updated package.json with monorepo standards
- ✅ Added @openagentsinc/ui as workspace dependency
- ✅ Created proper TypeScript configurations
- ✅ Set up vitest configuration
- ✅ Removed Vite-generated configs
- ✅ Created test directory structure

### 3. Testing UI Package Integration

Updated App.tsx to:
- Import Button component from @openagentsinc/ui
- Import PaneState type to test type exports
- Import global CSS styles
- Display various button variants and sizes

### 4. Build Status

- UI package built successfully
- Dependencies installed
- Ready to run playground

### 5. Export Configuration

Had to manually add exports to UI package.json for Vite to resolve the imports:
- Added export for button component
- Added export for CSS file
- Added export for type definitions

### 6. Running the Playground

The playground is now running successfully at http://localhost:5173/

To test:
```bash
pnpm --filter=@openagentsinc/playground dev
```

The playground demonstrates:
- Importing and using the Button component from @openagentsinc/ui
- All button variants (default, secondary, outline, ghost, destructive, link)
- All button sizes (sm, default, lg, icon)
- Importing types (PaneState) from the UI package
- Importing and using the global CSS styles

### 7. Verification Complete

The UI package is working correctly and can be imported by other packages in the monorepo. The playground serves as both a test environment and a demonstration of the UI components.
