## Context
Continuing work on issue #903 - extracting UI components from Commander repository into @openagentsinc/ui package.

## Current Status
- ✅ Initial package setup complete (PR #904)
- ✅ React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4 configured

- ✅ Berkeley Mono font integrated
- ✅ Dark theme configured with OKLCH colors

## Today's Goals
1. Extract core abstractions from Commander
2. Begin extracting Pane system components
3. Extract Hotbar components
4. Ensure all components work in playground

## Work Log

### 12:10 - Starting extraction work
- Checking out Commander repository to analyze component structure
- Creating todo list for today's tasks

### 12:15 - Commander UI Analysis Complete
Found key components:
- Pane system: `/src/panes/Pane.tsx`, `/src/panes/PaneManager.tsx`
- Hotbar: `/src/components/hud/Hotbar.tsx`, `/src/components/hud/HotbarItem.tsx`
- UI primitives: `/src/components/ui/` (Radix-based)
- Type definitions: `/src/types/pane.ts`, `/src/types/paneMenu.ts`

Dependencies identified:
- @use-gesture/react (already added)
- zustand (already added)
- @radix-ui components (already added)
- framer-motion (need to add)

### 12:20 - Starting Core Abstractions Extraction
Beginning with utility functions and type definitions

### 12:25 - Core Abstractions Complete
- ✅ Added OS utility functions (isMacOs, getModifierKey)
- ✅ Extracted pane types and interfaces
- ✅ Extracted pane menu types
- ✅ Added framer-motion dependency
- ✅ Updated exports in index.ts

### 12:30 - Starting UI Components Extraction
Extracting Radix-based UI components from Commander

### 12:35 - UI Components Progress
- ✅ Updated Button component with Slot support
- ✅ Added Input component
- ✅ Added Label component  
- ✅ Added Card component with sub-components

### 12:40 - Pane System Implementation
- ✅ Created basic Pane component with drag functionality
- ✅ Created PaneManager for orchestrating multiple panes
- ✅ Created pane store using zustand
- ✅ Integrated @use-gesture/react for drag handling

### 12:45 - Hotbar Implementation
- ✅ Created HotbarItem component
- ✅ Created Hotbar component with keyboard shortcuts (Cmd/Ctrl + 1-9)
- ✅ Made hotbar system generic and configurable

### 12:50 - Playground Testing Setup
- ✅ Updated playground to demonstrate all UI components
- ✅ Created interactive demo with pane system
- ✅ Added hotbar with keyboard shortcuts
- ✅ Fixed all linting issues
- ✅ All tests passing

## Summary

Successfully extracted and implemented core UI components from Commander:

1. **Core Abstractions**:
   - Pane types and interfaces
   - Pane menu system types
   - OS utility functions

2. **UI Components**:
   - Button (with Slot support)
   - Input
   - Label
   - Card (with sub-components)

3. **Pane System**:
   - Draggable Pane component
   - PaneManager for orchestration
   - Zustand-based state management

4. **Hotbar System**:
   - HotbarItem component
   - Hotbar with keyboard shortcuts
   - Configurable slots

## Next Steps for Issue #903

- Extract remaining UI components (Dialog, Dropdown Menu, etc.)
- Add resize functionality to panes
- Implement pane header menus
- Extract more complex components from Commander
- Create comprehensive test suite
- Add storybook or similar for component documentation
