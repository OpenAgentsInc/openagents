# AI Package Research and Specification Log

## 1525 - Initial Research Phase

### Documents Read

1. **Architecture Documentation**
   - `/docs/architecture.md` - OpenAgents architecture patterns and principles
   - Key insights: Effect-first design, schema-driven development, layer-based composition

2. **Effect AI Framework**
   - `/docs/effect/ai/01-introduction.md` - Provider-agnostic AI framework
   - `/docs/effect/ai/02-getting-started.md` - AiModel and Provider patterns
   - `/docs/effect/ai/03-execution-planning.md` - AiPlan for complex execution flows
   - `/docs/effect/ai/04-tool-use.md` - AiToolkit for function calling
   - Key insights: Effect AI provides excellent patterns for provider abstraction and tool integration

3. **Existing Research**
   - `/docs/research/ai-package.md` - Prior Claude research with comprehensive spec
   - Found existing detailed specification covering most requirements

4. **External Resources**
   - Vercel AI SDK v5 - Unified provider architecture, streaming, framework agnostic
   - Goose - Local AI agent with MCP support, extensible with custom LLMs
   - Claude Code SDK - CLI wrapper for non-interactive mode, MAX subscription required

### Key Decisions

1. **Build on Effect AI patterns** - Use AiModel, AiProvider, and AiToolkit concepts
2. **Extend rather than replace** - The existing research spec is comprehensive
3. **Focus on integration** - Vercel SDK as custom provider, Goose via CLI, Claude Code via SDK

### Next Steps

1. Create enhanced `docs/ai.md` incorporating new findings
2. Open GitHub issue with implementation plan
3. Focus on unique aspects: MCP abstraction, Claude MAX integration, unified tool interface

### Open Questions Identified

- How to handle MCP server lifecycle management
- Claude MAX authentication flow
- Vercel AI SDK v5 provider adapter pattern
- Tool calling standardization across providers

## 1545 - Specification and Issue Creation

### Actions Completed

1. **Created Enhanced Specification**
   - File: `/docs/ai.md`
   - Comprehensive specification building on prior research
   - Incorporated Effect AI patterns
   - Detailed provider integration strategies
   - Clear architecture and usage examples

2. **Created GitHub Issue**
   - Issue #907: https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/openagents/issues/907
   - Comprehensive implementation plan with 6 phases
   - Clear success criteria and testing strategy
   - Links to specification and related documentation

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Leverage Effect AI packages** for OpenAI and Anthropic
2. **Custom provider pattern** for Vercel AI SDK v5
3. **CLI wrapper approach** for Goose and Claude Code
4. **MCP abstraction** - hide complexity by default
5. **Unified tool interface** with provider adapters

### Implementation Priorities

1. Start with native Effect AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic)
2. Build core services using Effect patterns
3. Add advanced providers (Vercel, Goose, Claude Code)
4. Focus on developer experience with good abstractions
5. Comprehensive testing from the start
