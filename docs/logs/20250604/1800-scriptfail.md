# Claude Code CLI Execution Failure Log
## 2025-06-04 18:00

### Issue Summary
The Claude Code CLI integration is experiencing a critical failure where commands hang indefinitely when executed through Effect's CommandExecutor, despite working perfectly when run directly in the terminal.

### Symptoms
1. `npx tsx packages/cli/src/bin.ts ai check` - Works correctly, returns "Claude Code CLI is available!"
2. `npx tsx packages/cli/src/bin.ts ai prompt "say hello"` - Hangs indefinitely, never returns
3. Direct terminal execution: `claude --print "say hello" --output-format json` - Works perfectly, returns JSON response immediately

### Investigation Details

#### What We Tried
1. **Basic execution**: Commands hang at `executor.start(command)` 
2. **Added quotes to arguments**: Changed from `--print`, `text` to `--print`, `"text"` - Still hangs
3. **Stdin handling**: Tried `Command.stdin("inherit")` - Resulted in "Asynchronous forks do not support Buffer" error
4. **Closing stdin**: Tried closing stdin stream immediately - No effect
5. **Environment variables**: Added `CLAUDE_NONINTERACTIVE: "1"` - No effect
6. **Shell execution**: Used `sh -c` to run command - Still hangs

#### Key Findings
- The exact same command works perfectly when run directly in terminal
- The command is being constructed correctly: `claude --print "say hello" --output-format json`
- The issue appears to be with how Effect's CommandExecutor spawns the process
- The claude CLI may be detecting it's not in a TTY and behaving differently
- No error messages are produced - the process simply hangs indefinitely

#### Code State
The implementation in `packages/ai/src/providers/ClaudeCodeSimple.ts` has debugging logs showing:
- Command construction is correct
- The process starts but never completes
- Exit code is never reached

### Current Status
- Claude Code CLI integration is implemented but non-functional due to process execution issues
- All TypeScript compilation issues have been resolved
- The architecture and error handling are correct
- The issue is specifically with subprocess execution in the Effect platform

### Next Steps for Resolution
1. Investigate if claude CLI requires TTY allocation
2. Try using alternative process execution methods (e.g., execa, child_process directly)
3. Check if claude has a batch mode or specific flags for non-interactive execution
4. Consider reaching out to Effect community about CommandExecutor behavior with interactive CLIs

### Files Modified
- `/packages/ai/src/providers/ClaudeCodeSimple.ts` - Multiple attempts to fix execution
- `/packages/cli/src/Cli.ts` - Added Effect.scoped wrapper to commands
- Various debugging and logging additions

The core issue remains unresolved and requires deeper investigation into how the claude CLI detects and handles non-interactive environments.
