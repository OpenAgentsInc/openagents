# Implementation Log: NIP-01 Core Protocol with Pylon Relay

## 2340 - Starting Implementation

Beginning implementation of issue #912: Implement NIP-01 core protocol with Pylon relay.

### Initial Tasks
1. Rename `packages/server` to `packages/pylon`
2. Create new `packages/nostr` package
3. Implement core NIP-01 functionality
4. Set up test infrastructure

Starting with package renaming...

## 2345 - Package Renaming Complete

Successfully renamed `packages/server` to `packages/pylon`:
- Updated package.json name and description
- Updated all references in root package.json build scripts
- Updated tsconfig.json and tsconfig.build.json references
- Updated tsconfig.base.json path mappings (also fixed old @template references)
- Updated documentation files (CLAUDE.md, architecture.md)

Now creating the new nostr package...

## 2350 - Nostr Package Created

Successfully created the @openagentsinc/nostr package:
- Created package directory structure
- Set up package.json with appropriate dependencies (matching snstr):
  - @noble/curves for secp256k1 operations
  - @noble/hashes for SHA-256
  - @scure/base for encoding
  - ws for WebSocket
- Created all TypeScript configuration files
- Added package to root tsconfig references
- Updated build scripts to include nostr package

Now installing dependencies and starting NIP-01 implementation...

## 2355 - Core Schemas and Services Implemented

Fixed the @effect/schema deprecation issue - Schema is now imported directly from effect package.

Implemented core components:
1. **Schema.ts** - Complete NIP-01 schemas with Effect Schema:
   - Branded types: EventId, PublicKey, PrivateKey, Signature
   - Event schemas: NostrEvent, UnsignedEvent, EventParams
   - Message schemas: ClientMessage, RelayMessage
   - Filter schema for event queries

2. **Errors.ts** - Comprehensive error types:
   - Validation errors (InvalidEventId, InvalidSignature, etc.)
   - Crypto errors
   - Connection errors
   - Relay errors
   - All using Schema.TaggedError for type safety

3. **CryptoService.ts** - Cryptographic operations:
   - Key generation using @noble/curves
   - Schnorr signatures
   - SHA-256 hashing
   - Public key derivation
   - All operations return Effect types

4. **EventService.ts** - Event creation and validation:
   - Event creation from parameters
   - Event ID calculation (following NIP-01 serialization)
   - Signature generation and verification
   - Complete event validation

Now implementing the WebSocket relay connection...

## 0000 - WebSocket and Relay Services Complete

Implemented the core relay connectivity:

1. **WebSocketService.ts** - Low-level WebSocket management:
   - Connection establishment with timeout
   - Message queue using Effect Queue
   - Error handling and connection state management
   - Scoped resource management for automatic cleanup
   - Stream-based message handling

2. **RelayService.ts** - High-level Nostr relay operations:
   - Subscription management with HashMap state
   - REQ/EVENT/CLOSE message handling
   - Event publishing with OK confirmation
   - Stream-based event delivery
   - Proper cleanup on disconnect

3. **EphemeralRelay.ts** - In-memory relay for testing:
   - Complete NIP-01 relay implementation
   - Event storage and filtering
   - Subscription matching
   - WebSocket server setup
   - Helper functions for test scenarios

The architecture uses Effect's powerful abstractions:
- Scoped resources for connection lifecycle
- Streams for real-time event delivery
- Queues for message buffering
- Refs for state management
- Layers for dependency injection

Now writing comprehensive tests...

## 0005 - First Test Suite Created

Created CryptoService.test.ts with comprehensive tests for:
- Private key generation
- Public key derivation
- Message signing and verification
- SHA-256 hashing
- Error handling for invalid inputs

All tests use Effect's testing patterns with proper service provision.

Pausing to update GitHub issue and commit progress...

## 0010 - Linting Fixed and Committed

Fixed all linting errors:
- Removed unused imports and variables
- Fixed generator function syntax
- Added missing newlines at end of files
- Corrected import ordering

Commit successful: 3c5aad8b4

Now pushing to remote...

## 0015 - Fixed TypeScript and Layer Issues

Major fixes applied:
- Changed service implementations from Effect.gen to proper Layer patterns
- Fixed Layer.succeed usage - services now use Layer.effect or Layer.succeed with proper structure
- Fixed test to use layers directly instead of wrapping in Layer.succeed
- Fixed import issues in EphemeralRelay - changed type imports to regular imports where needed
- Fixed Effect.runSync usage patterns
- Fixed array conversion from HashMap iterators
- Updated ConnectionClosed to ConnectionError to match expected types

All TypeScript errors resolved. Services now properly expose their implementations through Effect Layers.
