# Implementation Log: Completing Issue #912 - NIP-01 Core Protocol

## 2427 - Continuing Implementation

Continuing work on issue #912 to complete all remaining tasks for the Nostr NIP-01 implementation.

### Remaining Tasks:
1. Fix import() type annotations warnings in ClaudeCodeClient.ts
2. Handle generated files with proper .gitignore rules
3. Implement connection pooling for multiple relays
4. Add automatic reconnection logic
5. Create Pylon WebSocket server implementation
6. Implement event storage layer
7. Add filter matching engine
8. Create integration tests
9. Open pull request to close #912

Starting with fixing the import warnings...

## 2428 - Fixing Import Type Annotations

The ClaudeCodeClient.ts file has warnings about using `import()` type annotations. These need to be converted to proper type imports.

## 2430 - Import Warnings Fixed

Fixed all import() type annotations in ClaudeCodeClient.ts by:
- Adding proper type imports at the top of the file
- Replacing all inline import() expressions with direct type references
- All 14 warnings have been resolved

## 2432 - .gitignore Updated

Added rules to .gitignore to ignore generated TypeScript files in src directories:
```
# Generated TypeScript files in src directories
packages/*/src/**/*.d.ts
packages/*/src/**/*.d.ts.map
packages/*/src/**/*.js
packages/*/src/**/*.js.map
# But keep the actual source TypeScript files
!packages/*/src/**/*.ts
!packages/*/src/**/*.tsx
```

This prevents generated files from being committed while keeping source files tracked.

## 2435 - Implementing Connection Pooling

Now implementing connection pooling for RelayService to handle multiple relay connections. Looking at snstr and nostr-tools for reference implementations.

## 2440 - Connection Pool Implemented

Created RelayPoolService that manages multiple relay connections:
- Connects to multiple relays simultaneously
- Deduplicates events across relays
- Tracks which relays have seen each event
- Supports publishing to all relays
- Provides connection status for each relay

## 2445 - Automatic Reconnection Added

Implemented RelayReconnectService with:
- Exponential backoff reconnection strategy
- Configurable retry parameters
- Connection monitoring
- Automatic reconnection on disconnect
- Clean shutdown support

## 2450 - Pylon WebSocket Server Created

Implemented the Nostr relay server in Pylon package:
- Full NIP-01 WebSocket protocol support
- NIP-11 relay information endpoint
- Event storage and retrieval
- Subscription management
- Filter-based event matching
- Client connection management

## 2455 - Storage and Filter Services

Created supporting services:
1. EventStorage - In-memory event storage with indexes:
   - Author index for efficient author queries
   - Kind index for event type filtering
   - Tag indexes for tag-based queries
   - Time-based filtering support

2. FilterMatcher - Event filtering engine:
   - ID prefix matching
   - Author prefix matching
   - Kind filtering
   - Time constraints
   - Tag filtering (e, p, and custom tags)

## 2500 - Integration Tests Added

Added comprehensive integration tests:
- Basic relay operations (connect, publish, subscribe)
- Event filtering by kind
- Multiple subscriptions
- Relay pool with deduplication
- Partial relay failure handling

All core NIP-01 functionality is now implemented!
