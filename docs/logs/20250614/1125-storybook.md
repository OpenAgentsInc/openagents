- [x] Examined current UI package structure (React-based components)
- [x] Created GitHub issue #917 describing the work
- [x] Set up work logging

## Current Status: Basic infrastructure complete, ready for testing

## Completed Implementation
1. ✅ Created @openagentsinc/storybook package with custom renderer
2. ✅ Installed required Typed and Storybook dependencies  
3. ✅ Set up examples/storybook application structure
4. ✅ Created Button and Card stories with OpenAgents styling
5. ✅ Fixed TypeScript compilation issues
6. ✅ All typechecks passing

## Package Structure Created
- `packages/storybook/` - Custom Storybook renderer
  - Basic Effect-based rendering setup
  - TypeScript configuration
  - Package dependencies for Typed framework
- `examples/storybook/` - Storybook application
  - Main and preview configuration
  - Button and Card stories with OpenAgents styling
  - Berkeley Mono font integration

## Next Steps
- Commit current progress
- Test Storybook build and startup
- Create pull request
- Wait for CI checks to pass

## Architecture Notes
Following docs/typed-storybook.md pattern:
- Custom Storybook renderer with Effect integration
- Template system using @typed/template
- Comprehensive TypeScript types
- Fiber-based cleanup and lifecycle management

## Styling Requirements
- Black background
