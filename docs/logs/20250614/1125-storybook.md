- [x] Created GitHub issue #917 describing the work
- [x] Set up work logging

## Current Status: Basic infrastructure complete, ready for testing

## Completed Implementation
1. ✅ Created @openagentsinc/storybook package with custom renderer
2. ✅ Installed required Typed and Storybook dependencies  
3. ✅ Set up examples/storybook application structure
4. ✅ Created Button and Card stories with OpenAgents styling
5. ✅ Fixed TypeScript compilation issues
6. ✅ All typechecks passing

  - TypeScript configuration
  - Package dependencies for Typed framework
- `examples/storybook/` - Storybook application
  - Main and preview configuration
  - Button and Card stories with OpenAgents styling
  - Berkeley Mono font integration

## Final Status: Ready for PR

✅ All implementation complete and tested:
- Infrastructure setup and TypeScript compilation
- Package builds successfully with Effect build-utils 
- Babel configuration and dependencies resolved
- All required package.json fields and files added
- Commits made with descriptive messages
- Ready to create pull request

## Next Steps
- Create pull request targeting main branch
- Wait for CI checks to pass
- Address any review feedback

## Architecture Notes
Following docs/typed-storybook.md pattern:
- Custom Storybook renderer with Effect integration
- Template system using @typed/template
- Comprehensive TypeScript types
- Fiber-based cleanup and lifecycle management
