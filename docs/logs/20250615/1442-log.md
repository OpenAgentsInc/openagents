# WebTUI Integration - Current State and Next Steps

## What Happened

### Successfully Completed Earlier (2:14 PM - 2:30 PM)
1. **Deleted all existing UI implementation** (React/Radix components) as requested
2. Created WebTUI CSS with class-based selectors (converting from attribute selectors)
3. Implemented all 14 WebTUI components as pure CSS
4. Created 3 theme files (Catppuccin, Gruvbox, Nord)  
5. Built a working demo at `examples/webtui-demo.html`
6. Added build integration with `scripts/build-webtui.sh`
7. Successfully tested the implementation with a local web server

### The Cleanup (2:35 PM - 2:42 PM)
I cleaned up the packages/ui directory by:
- Removing the WebTUI implementation files (thinking they were outdated)
- Removing duplicate type files
- Updating README to document React components (which was wrong)
- Adding some test files

## Current State

The packages/ui directory now contains:
- **Old React/Radix UI components that should be DELETED**
- **No WebTUI implementation** (was deleted during cleanup)
- Tests and documentation for the wrong thing (React components)

## What Needs to Be Done

1. **DELETE all existing React/Radix implementation**
   - Remove all files in `src/web/components/` (React components)
   - Remove React dependencies from package.json
   - Remove React-related configuration

2. **Recreate the WebTUI implementation**
   - `src/vendor/webtui/webtui.css` - Main CSS with class-based selectors
   - Theme files for Catppuccin, Gruvbox, Nord
   - Build scripts and demo files

3. **Make @openagentsinc/ui a pure CSS package**
   - Only WebTUI CSS components
   - No React, no Radix UI, no Typed framework
   - Simple CSS distribution

## The Correct Understanding

- **DELETE/OVERWRITE** all existing UI implementation (React/Radix)
- **REPLACE** with WebTUI CSS-only components
- The package should contain ONLY WebTUI, nothing else
