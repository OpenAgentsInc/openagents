# WebTUI Cards Implementation Log
Date: 2025-06-15 19:05

## Context
- Working on issue #919 (WebTUI integration) 
- PR #921 was merged with partial implementation (8/14 components)
- Current implementation uses class-based selectors instead of WebTUI's attribute-based
- Missing the ASCII box drawing system which is WebTUI's signature feature

## Goal
Convert Pylon UI to use WebTUI cards with proper box drawing styles

## Current State
- Pylon has custom cards with `.pylon-card` and `.ollama-status-card`
- WebTUI CSS has `.webtui-box` with variants (single, round, double)
- Need to convert existing cards to use WebTUI box components

## Implementation Plan
1. Examine current WebTUI box/card implementation
2. Convert Pylon cards to use WebTUI box components
3. Ensure proper ASCII box drawing renders
4. Test with different themes

## Findings

### Current WebTUI Box Implementation
The current WebTUI CSS has basic box styles but lacks the ASCII box drawing system:

Available box classes:
- `.webtui-box` - Basic box with border and padding
- `.webtui-box-square` - Regular solid border (default)
- `.webtui-box-round` - Rounded corners
- `.webtui-box-double` - Double border style

Missing features:
- ASCII box drawing characters (╭╮╰╯│─ etc.)
- Single-line box drawing style
- Box shadow effects
- Terminal-style decorative borders

### Current Pylon Cards
1. `.pylon-card` - Main title card with large padding
2. `.ollama-status-card` - Status indicator card

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Implement ASCII box drawing in WebTUI CSS
I'll add proper ASCII box drawing characters to create terminal-style boxes.

ASCII box characters to implement:
- Single line: ┌ ┐ └ ┘ ─ │
- Double line: ╔ ╗ ╚ ╝ ═ ║
- Rounded: ╭ ╮ ╰ ╯ ─ │

### Step 2: ASCII Box Implementation Complete

Successfully implemented ASCII box drawing in WebTUI CSS with:
- Single-line boxes using ┌ ┐ └ ┘ characters
- Double-line boxes using ╔ ╗ ╚ ╝ characters  
- Rounded boxes using ╭ ╮ ╰ ╯ characters
- Added `.box-corners` span elements to hold bottom corners

The implementation uses CSS pseudo-elements (::before and ::after) on both the box element and a `.box-corners` span to position all four corner characters correctly.

### Step 3: Updated Pylon to use WebTUI boxes

Converted Pylon cards to use:
- `webtui-box webtui-box-double` for the main Pylon title card
- `webtui-box webtui-box-single` for the Ollama status card
- Added required `.box-corners` span elements

### Current Status
- ASCII box drawing is now working with proper corner characters
- Pylon UI has been converted to use WebTUI boxes
- Built and deployed the updated CSS

### Step 4: Created Pull Request

Successfully created PR #925: "feat: Implement ASCII box drawing for WebTUI cards"
- https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/openagents/pull/925
- Implements ASCII box drawing for issue #919
- Adds terminal-style box rendering to Pylon UI

## Summary

Successfully implemented ASCII box drawing characters for WebTUI cards:
1. Added CSS implementation for single-line, double-line, and rounded box styles
2. Used pseudo-elements and `.box-corners` spans to position corner characters
3. Converted Pylon UI to use WebTUI boxes
4. Fixed TypeScript errors and pushed changes
5. Created PR #925 to merge into main branch

The implementation gives Pylon cards an authentic terminal appearance with proper ASCII box drawing.

### Step 5: Updated to Match WebTUI's Actual Implementation

After examining the WebTUI source code at `/Users/christopherdavid/code/webtui`, I discovered:
- WebTUI does NOT use actual ASCII box-drawing characters
- They use pure CSS borders with pseudo-elements for clean box rendering
- The approach uses `ch` and `lh` units for terminal-style spacing
- Double boxes use two borders via ::before and ::after pseudo-elements

Updated implementation to match WebTUI's approach:
1. Removed ASCII characters and `.box-corners` spans
2. Implemented CSS-only box drawing using pseudo-elements
3. Used proper `ch` and `lh` units for padding and calculations
4. Matched WebTUI's exact border positioning technique

This CSS-based approach is more reliable and avoids font rendering issues.

### Step 6: Added Corner Labels and Removed Pylon Card

Based on user feedback:
1. Removed the main "Pylon" title card at the top
2. Added ability to place labels in box corners
3. Implemented CSS classes for all four corner positions:
   - `.box-label-top-left`
   - `.box-label-top-right`
   - `.box-label-bottom-left`
   - `.box-label-bottom-right`
4. Added "Pylon" branding to top-left corner of status card
5. Added descriptive labels to boxes (Status, Models)

The corner labels are positioned to overlap the box borders perfectly, with proper z-index and background color to ensure readability.

### Step 7: Fixed Box Implementation to Match WebTUI Exactly

After reviewing WebTUI's actual implementation:
1. Used `webtui-box-shear-top` to remove top padding
2. Implemented `webtui-box-header` with flexbox for corner positioning
3. Removed absolute positioning approach in favor of WebTUI's flex layout
4. Added proper background colors to labels to cover border lines
5. Used `box-content` wrapper for proper padding of inner content

This matches WebTUI's exact implementation pattern from their examples.
