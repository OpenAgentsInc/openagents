# NIP-06 Implementation Log
**Date:** 2025-06-15  
**Time:** 2505  
**Issue:** #927 - Implement NIP-06 Effect Service for Key Derivation

## Overview
Implementing NIP-06 (Basic key derivation from mnemonic seed phrase) as an Effect service following existing patterns in the nostr package.

## Analysis Complete
- âœ… Analyzed issue #926 for agent identity requirements
- âœ… Studied Pylon's NIP-06 implementation for reference patterns
- âœ… Reviewed NIP-01 and NIP-06 specifications
- âœ… Examined existing Effect service patterns (CryptoService)
- âœ… Studied test patterns from EphemeralRelay
- âœ… Created GitHub issue #927
- âœ… Added required dependencies: @scure/bip39@1.6.0, @scure/bip32@1.7.0

## Implementation Plan
1. Add Nip06Error to core/Errors.ts
2. Extend Schema.ts with mnemonic, nsec/npub types
3. Implement Nip06Service following CryptoService patterns
4. Create nip06/index.ts layer
5. Write comprehensive tests with NIP-06 test vectors
6. Run codegen and typecheck

## Key Requirements
- BIP39 mnemonic generation/validation (12-24 words)
- BIP32 HD derivation: `m/44'/1237'/<account>'/0/0`
- nsec/npub encoding using bech32
- Integration with existing CryptoService
- Comprehensive error handling

## Implementation Log

### 2505 - Starting Implementation
- Created feature branch: feat/nip06-service
- Beginning with core error types and schemas

### 2507 - Core Types Added
- âœ… Added NIP-06 error classes to core/Errors.ts:
  - `Nip06Error` for general operations
  - `InvalidMnemonic` for mnemonic validation failures  
  - `KeyDerivationError` for HD wallet derivation issues
- âœ… Added NIP-06 schemas to core/Schema.ts:
  - `Mnemonic` with 12/15/18/21/24 word validation
  - `Nsec`/`Npub` with bech32 pattern validation
  - `DerivationPath` for BIP32 path validation
  - `KeyDerivationResult` class for complete results

### 2515 - Service Implementation Complete
- âœ… Created nip06/ directory following nip01 pattern
- âœ… Implemented Nip06Service with full NIP-06 spec:
  - BIP39 mnemonic generation/validation (12-24 words)
  - BIP32 HD key derivation (m/44'/1237'/account'/0/0)
  - nsec/npub bech32 encoding/decoding
  - Complete key derivation pipeline
  - Integration with CryptoService
- âœ… Created nip06/index.ts with service layers
- âœ… Fixed import paths and dependency structure

### 2520 - Comprehensive Test Suite
- âœ… Created test/Nip06Service.test.ts with:
  - Test vectors from NIP-06 specification
  - Mnemonic generation/validation tests
  - Key derivation accuracy tests
  - nsec/npub encoding round-trip tests
  - Account derivation tests
  - Integration tests with CryptoService
  - Error handling tests

### 2525 - Final Integration & Testing
- âœ… Fixed TypeScript compilation issues:
  - bech32 decode type compatibility
  - Import path corrections
  - Service dependency resolution
- âœ… All tests passing (21/21)
- âœ… TypeScript compilation successful
- âœ… Effect codegen completed successfully
- ðŸŽ¯ NIP-06 implementation complete and functional!
