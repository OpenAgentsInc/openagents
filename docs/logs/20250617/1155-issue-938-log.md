# Issue #938: Create openagents.com website using Psionic framework

**Date:** 2025-06-17  
**Time Started:** 11:55  
**Issue:** https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/openagents/issues/938

## Objective

Implement the new openagents.com website as a Psionic application, establishing the `apps/` directory pattern and extracting Psionic as a consumable framework.

## Plan

1. Establish apps/ directory structure
2. Move pylon and playground from packages/ to apps/
3. Extract Psionic framework from current hello world
4. Create openagents.com as first Psionic app
5. Update all imports and ensure builds work

## Implementation Log

### 11:55 - Starting implementation

Created feature branch: `feat/issue-938-openagents-website`

### 11:56 - Phase 1: Establish apps/ directory

First, I'll update the pnpm workspace configuration to include apps/

✅ Updated pnpm-workspace.yaml to include apps/*
✅ Created apps/ directory
✅ Moved packages/pylon → apps/pylon
✅ Moved packages/playground → apps/playground
✅ Updated README.md to reflect new structure
✅ Updated CLAUDE.md to document packages vs apps

### 12:00 - Phase 2: Extract Psionic framework

Now I need to transform Psionic from a hello world app into a consumable framework.

✅ Created examples directory and moved hello world there
✅ Created core framework structure:
  - core/app.ts - Main PsionicApp class with routing
  - core/templates.ts - HTML/CSS template helpers
  - types/index.ts - TypeScript interfaces
✅ Updated src/index.ts to export framework API
✅ Updated package.json to run example in dev mode
✅ Converted example to use new framework API
✅ Updated README with framework documentation

### 12:10 - Phase 3: Create openagents.com app

Now I'll create the openagents.com website as a Psionic application.

✅ Created apps/openagents.com directory structure
✅ Created package.json with Psionic dependency
✅ Created tsconfig.json and bunfig.toml
✅ Created main app entry point (src/index.ts)
✅ Created shared styles and navigation component
✅ Implemented all routes:
  - Home page with hero and feature cards
  - Agents marketplace with mock data
  - Documentation page with quick start
  - About page with mission and technology
✅ Added README and .gitignore
✅ Updated main README to include new app

### 12:20 - Phase 4: Install dependencies and test

Now I need to install dependencies and ensure everything works.

✅ Ran pnpm install to update dependencies
✅ Fixed TypeScript configuration issues:
  - Updated vitest workspace to include apps/
  - Added missing tsconfig for pylon app
  - Fixed playground reference to AI package
  - Updated psionic to be a composite project
  - Disabled JS checking for pylon app
✅ Fixed all linting errors (double quotes)
