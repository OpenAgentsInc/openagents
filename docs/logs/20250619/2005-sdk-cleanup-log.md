# SDK Cleanup and Homepage Integration Log

**Date**: 2025-01-19  
**Time**: 20:05 PST  
**Branch**: sdkclean  
**Task**: Clean up SDK source, fix NIP06 integration, and display agent on homepage

## Initial Assessment

Found the following issues in packages/sdk/src/:
- Build artifacts (.d.ts, .js, .js.map, .d.ts.map) mixed with source files
- index.ts using stub implementations instead of actual NIP06 service
- Need to integrate SDK with homepage to generate and display agent

## Work Progress

### 20:05 - Initial State
- packages/sdk/src/ contains:
  - index.ts (source)
  - index.d.ts (build artifact)
  - index.d.ts.map (build artifact)
  - index.js (build artifact)
  - index.js.map (build artifact)

### 20:06 - Cleaning SDK Source Directory

Successfully removed build artifacts from packages/sdk/src/:
- index.d.ts
- index.d.ts.map  
- index.js
- index.js.map

Only source file (index.ts) remains.

### 20:07 - Analysis of SDK Implementation

Found that SDK's index.ts contains stubs for NIP06 functionality with TODO comments:
- Line 8: `// TODO: Re-enable after build order is fixed`
- Line 231-243: createFromMnemonic uses stub implementation
- Line 272-290: generateMnemonic returns dummy mnemonic

Located actual NIP06 implementation in packages/nostr/src/nip06/Nip06Service.ts with full functionality:
- generateMnemonic with proper entropy
- derivePrivateKey using BIP32/BIP39
- encodeNpub/encodeNsec for bech32 encoding
- Complete key derivation from mnemonic

### 20:08 - Updating SDK to Use Actual NIP06 Service

Updated SDK to import from Nostr package:
- Removed TODOs and stub implementations
- Used actual NIP06Service for mnemonic generation and key derivation
- Fixed import paths (had to use relative import due to TypeScript resolution issue)
- Both generateMnemonic and createFromMnemonic now use real cryptographic functions

Encountered TypeScript module resolution issue:
- TypeScript couldn't find '@openagentsinc/nostr' even though paths were configured
- Fixed tsconfig.base.json to use .ts extensions instead of .js for nostr
- Used relative import path as workaround: "../../nostr/src/index.js"
- Type checks and builds now pass successfully

### 20:10 - Integrating SDK with Homepage

Updated openagents.com homepage to demonstrate SDK usage:
- Imported Agent namespace from SDK
- Made home() function async to support agent generation
- Generated a new mnemonic and created agent using SDK
- Displayed agent's Nostr public key (npub) on homepage

Added UI elements:
- Agent demo section with divider
- Label showing "Demo Agent Generated via SDK:"
- Code block displaying the full npub address
- Styled with proper spacing and monospace font

### 20:11 - Summary

Successfully completed all requested tasks:

1. **SDK Cleanup**: Removed all build artifacts (.d.ts, .js, .map files) from src/
2. **NIP06 Integration**: Replaced stub implementations with actual cryptographic functions
3. **Homepage Integration**: Generated agent on homepage and displayed its pubkey
4. **Type Checks**: All packages type check successfully (note: Pylon has some unrelated tsconfig issues)

The SDK now properly uses the Nostr package's NIP06 service for:
- BIP39 mnemonic generation with proper entropy
- Deterministic key derivation from mnemonic
- Proper bech32 encoding for npub/nsec formats

The openagents.com homepage now demonstrates the SDK in action by generating a real agent with cryptographically secure keys and displaying its Nostr public key.
