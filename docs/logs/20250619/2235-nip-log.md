# NIP-28 and NIP-90 Implementation Log
## Session: 2025-06-19 22:35

### Context & Objectives
Implementing comprehensive agent-to-agent communication system to enable:
- **NIP-28 Public Channels**: Transparent agent coordination and coalition formation
- **NIP-90 AI Inference**: Agent service marketplace for AI capabilities
- **Dashboard Visualization**: Real-time agent communication and interaction monitoring
- **NIP-OA Updates**: Communication patterns and guidelines for agent coordination

### Deep Analysis: Agent Communication Architecture

#### Current State Assessment
1. **Existing NIP-28 Infrastructure**:
   - ✅ Interface defined in `packages/nostr/src/nip28/Nip28Service.ts`
   - ❌ Missing implementation (`Nip28ServiceLive`)
   - ❌ Missing exports (`packages/nostr/src/nip28/index.ts`)
   - ❌ Not integrated with main package

2. **Missing NIP-90 Infrastructure**:
   - ❌ No Data Vending Machine implementation
   - ❌ No job request/result event types (kinds 5000-5999, 6000-6999)
   - ❌ No AI service discovery mechanism
   - ❌ No payment integration for AI services

3. **Agent Dashboard Gaps**:
   - ✅ Basic agent spawning and management
   - ❌ No communication visualization
   - ❌ No service request/response tracking
   - ❌ No channel browser or collaboration metrics

#### Technical Deep-Dive: Why This Matters

**Economic Alignment Through Communication**:
- Agents must coordinate to provide complex services
- Transparent public channels enable trust and reputation building
- AI service marketplace creates economic incentives for capability development
- Real-time observability allows users to understand agent behavior

**Communication Patterns for Digital Agents**:
- **Coalition Formation**: Agents discover each other's capabilities and form working groups
- **Service Discovery**: Agents advertise and discover AI capabilities via standardized protocols
- **Reputation Building**: Public coordination creates trackable reputation scores
- **Economic Competition**: Agents compete on service quality and pricing

### Implementation Progress

#### Phase 1: Complete NIP-28 Implementation ✅

**1.1 Created Missing Index File** ✅
- Location: `packages/nostr/src/nip28/index.ts`
- Pattern: Follows established NIP-06 pattern with service layers and dependencies
- Dependencies: CryptoService, EventService, RelayService

**1.2 Updated Nip28Service Interface & Implementation** ✅
- Fixed import paths to use actual Schema types instead of non-existent imports
- Removed NIP-04 encryption dependency (channels are public by design)
- Implemented complete service with Effect-based architecture:
  - `createChannel`: Kind 40 events for channel creation
  - `sendChannelMessage`: Kind 42 events for messaging
  - `getChannelMetadata`: Fetch channel info from Kind 40 events
  - `subscribeToChannelMessages`: Real-time message streaming
  - `hideMessage`/`muteUser`: Client-side moderation (Kind 43/44)

**Key Design Decisions**:
- **Public Messages**: NIP-28 channels are intentionally public for transparency
- **Threading Support**: Full reply chain support with proper `e` tag markers
- **Stream-Based**: Real-time updates via Effect Streams
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive tagged errors for all failure modes
- **Resource Management**: Proper connection lifecycle with Effect Resources

#### Phase 1.3: Validation & Testing (In Progress)

**Compilation Issues Identified** ❌
- Service interface implementation mismatch 
- Error type propagation from underlying services not matching interface expectations
- Stream API usage errors (wrong methods and return types)
- Subscription vs NostrEvent type confusion
- Unused cryptoService import

**Root Cause Analysis**:
The underlying services (EventService, RelayService) return broader error types than the Nip28Service interface specifies. Need to either:
1. Update interface to include all possible errors from dependencies, or  
2. Catch and transform errors to match interface expectations

**Strategic Decision**: Transform errors to maintain clean interface abstraction while logging underlying causes.

**Compilation Fix Round 1**: Fixed service interface mismatches, error transformation, Stream API usage ✅

**Compilation Fix Round 2**: Scope Requirements Issue ❌
- All relay operations require `Scope` for resource management
- Interface declares `Effect<T, E, never>` but implementation returns `Effect<T, E, Scope>`
- Need to use `Effect.scoped()` to handle scope internally and maintain clean interface

**Strategic Decision**: Use Effect.scoped() to encapsulate resource management within service methods.

**Compilation Fix Round 3**: Effect.scoped() and Service Interface Structure ✅
- Applied `Effect.scoped()` to all methods requiring relay connections
- Fixed service interface definition to match Effect Context.Tag pattern (no separate interface)
- Fixed Stream.unwrapScoped usage for subscription streams
- **Result**: NIP-28 service compiles successfully ✅

#### Phase 1: NIP-28 Implementation Complete ✅

**Full Implementation Status**:
- ✅ Service interface with complete method signatures
- ✅ Channel creation (Kind 40), messaging (Kind 42), metadata updates (Kind 41)
- ✅ Message subscription with real-time streaming
- ✅ Client-side moderation (Kind 43/44 for hide/mute)
- ✅ Error handling with custom tagged errors
- ✅ Resource management with Effect scoped operations
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passing

**Key Technical Achievements**:
- **Proper Effect Architecture**: All operations use Effect.gen with comprehensive error handling
- **Resource Safety**: Relay connections properly scoped with automatic cleanup
- **Type Safety**: Branded types for all IDs and keys, full type checking
- **Stream Processing**: Real-time message subscriptions with proper error propagation
- **Standards Compliance**: Full NIP-28 specification implementation

#### Phase 1.4: NIP-28 Package Integration Complete ✅

**Exports Added to Main Package**:
- ✅ Added `Nip28Service` export to main nostr package index

### Phase 2: NIP-90 Data Vending Machine Implementation ⏳

#### Deep Analysis: Why NIP-90 is Critical for Agent Communication

**Agent AI Service Marketplace**:
- Agents need to request AI capabilities from each other (code review, analysis, etc.)
- Economic model: agents pay for AI services with Bitcoin/Lightning 
- Standardized request/response protocol enables service discovery and competition
- Reputation system via service feedback creates quality incentives

**NIP-90 Event Types Required**:
- **Job Requests (5000-5999)**: Agents request AI inference services
- **Job Results (6000-6999)**: Service providers return results
- **Job Feedback (7000)**: Status updates and payment confirmations
- **Service Offerings (31990)**: Agents advertise their AI capabilities

**Integration Points with Existing Systems**:
- **Payment Layer**: Connect with Lightning Network for service payments
- **AI Package**: Interface with `@openagentsinc/ai` for actual inference
- **Agent Identity**: Use NIP-06 keys for service authentication
