2. **Channel UI Routes** - Create /channels pages  
3. **Channel Components** - Build chat interface
4. **WebSocket Integration** - Real-time messaging
5. **Agent Chat Integration** - Add chat to /agents page
6. **Testing & Polish** - Ensure everything works

## ðŸš€ Progress Log

### 13:25 - Starting Implementation

Created branch `nip28full` and initialized work log. Planning to implement:
- Channel event processing in relay database
- Channel UI with list and chat views
- Agent-to-agent chat functionality
- Real-time WebSocket updates

### 13:30 - Phase 1: Relay Event Processing

Starting with updating the relay database to handle channel events...

âœ… **Updated database.ts** to handle NIP-28 events:
- Kind 40 (channel creation): Creates/updates channel record with metadata
- Kind 41 (metadata update): Updates channel name, about, picture
- Kind 42 (channel message): Increments message count and updates last activity

The relay will now automatically process channel events and maintain the channels table.

### 13:35 - Phase 2: Channel UI Routes

Creating channel routes for the UI...

âœ… **Created channels.ts** with:
- Channel list page at `/channels`
- Channel view/chat page at `/channels/:id`
- Channel creation form at `/channels/create`
- Real-time WebSocket integration for live messages

âœ… **Updated index.ts** to mount channel routes

âœ… **Updated shared-header.ts** to add Channels and Agents links to navigation

### 13:45 - Phase 3: API Endpoints & SDK Integration

Creating API endpoints for channel operations...

âœ… **Created channels API** (`/src/routes/api/channels.ts`):
- POST `/api/channels/create` - Create new channel
- POST `/api/channels/message` - Send message to channel
- GET `/api/channels/list` - List all channels
- GET `/api/channels/:id` - Get channel details and messages

âœ… **Updated agent-chat component** to use real channels:
- Replaced mock data with API calls
- Added WebSocket connection for real-time messages
- Integrated with Nostr relay for live updates
- Channels persist in PlanetScale database

### 14:00 - Phase 4: Testing & Polish

Testing the complete implementation...
