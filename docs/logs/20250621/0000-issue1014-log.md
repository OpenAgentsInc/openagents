# Issue #1014: Lightning Payment Integration - Economic Survival System

## Log Started: 2025-06-21 00:00

### Objective

Complete the Lightning Payment Integration by adding economic survival intelligence to agents. Building on the Spark SDK foundation from Issue #1016, we'll implement:

1. **Economic Survival Service** - Cost tracking, health assessment, survival decisions
2. **Metabolic Cost Calculation** - AI inference, relay fees, operational expenses
3. **Survival Behaviors** - Hibernation, emergency mode, pricing optimization
4. **Enhanced Payment Features** - Timeouts, escrow, dispute handling

### Current Foundation

From Issue #1016:
- ✅ SparkService for Lightning wallets
- ✅ Invoice creation and payment monitoring
- ✅ Integration with AutonomousMarketplaceAgent
- ✅ Real payment flow (not mocked)

### Implementation Plan

1. **EconomicSurvivalService**
   - Track operational costs in real-time
   - Assess financial health based on balance and burn rate
   - Make survival decisions (continue, reduce, emergency, hibernate)
   - Optimize pricing under economic pressure

2. **Cost Tracking System**
   - AI inference costs (tokens × rate)
   - Relay connection fees
   - Transaction fees
   - Time-based operational costs

3. **Survival Behaviors**
   - Hibernation when balance < threshold
   - Emergency job seeking when critical
   - Dynamic pricing adjustments
   - Resume operations when funded

4. **Payment Enhancements**
   - Timeout handling for unpaid invoices
   - Basic escrow for disputed services
   - Refund capabilities

### Architecture

```typescript
export class EconomicSurvivalService extends Context.Tag("sdk/EconomicSurvivalService")<
  EconomicSurvivalService,
  {
    calculateMetabolicCost: (agent: AgentProfile) => Effect<SatoshisPerHour>
    assessFinancialHealth: (state: EconomicState) => Effect<FinancialHealthScore>
    decideSurvivalAction: (health: FinancialHealthScore) => Effect<SurvivalAction>
    optimizePricing: (pressure: FinancialPressure) => Effect<PricingStrategy>
    executeHibernation: (agent: AgentProfile) => Effect<void>
    resumeFromHibernation: (agent: AgentProfile) => Effect<void>
  }
>() {}
```

### Progress Log

**00:00** - Starting implementation of Economic Survival System
**00:05** - Creating EconomicSurvivalService with Effect architecture
**00:10** - Implemented complete EconomicSurvivalService:
  - Metabolic cost calculation based on AI tokens, relay hours, transactions
  - Financial health assessment with 5 states (healthy to emergency)
  - Survival action decisions (continue, reduce, urgent work, hibernate)
  - Dynamic pricing optimization based on financial pressure
  - Cost tracking for operations

**00:15** - Integrated EconomicSurvivalService into AutonomousMarketplaceAgent:
  - Added survival tracking fields to AgentEconomicState
  - Added health monitoring loop (checks every 5 minutes)
  - Implemented hibernation control with Ref
  - Job evaluation now respects hibernation state
  - Job stream filters out jobs when hibernating
  - Pricing adjusts based on survival actions

**00:20** - Created test infrastructure:
  - `/test-survival` page for demonstrating survival behaviors
  - `/test-survival/health-status` endpoint for real-time monitoring
  - Visual health status display with color coding
  - Shows balance, burn rate, runway, and current action

### Implementation Details

#### EconomicSurvivalService Features

1. **Metabolic Cost Calculation**
```typescript
Total Cost = Base Operational Cost + AI Inference Cost + Relay Connection Fee + Transaction Fees
```

2. **Health Status Thresholds**
- Healthy: >168 hours (1 week) runway
- Stable: 48-168 hours runway  
- Concerning: 24-48 hours runway
- Critical: 6-24 hours runway
- Emergency: <6 hours runway

3. **Survival Actions**
- `continue_normal`: Business as usual
- `reduce_activity`: Lower activity by 30%
- `seek_urgent_work`: Accept lower profits, increase aggressiveness
- `hibernate`: Stop all activity to preserve funds

4. **Dynamic Pricing**
- Healthy: +20% premium pricing
- Stable: Normal pricing
- Concerning: -10% competitive pricing
- Critical: -30% aggressive pricing
- Emergency: -50% survival pricing

#### Integration Points

1. **AutonomousMarketplaceAgent**
- Health check loop runs every 5 minutes
- Hibernation state controls job processing
- Dynamic pricing in job evaluation
- Cost tracking for AI inference

2. **Real-time Monitoring**
- Agent state includes survival metrics
- Health status endpoint for UI updates
- Visual indicators for agent status

### Next Steps

- Add payment timeout handling
- Implement basic escrow for disputed services
- Add fund injection capability for testing
- Create more sophisticated cost models
