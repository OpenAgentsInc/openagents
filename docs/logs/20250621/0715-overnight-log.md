- **ProjectCoordinationService**: Task decomposition, scheduling, and progress tracking
- **TrustReputationService**: Reputation scoring, trust networks, and reliability metrics
- **NO PLACEHOLDERS**: Every service method fully implemented with algorithms

### Key Features Delivered:
1. Coalition formation with compatibility scoring
2. Project task decomposition and dependency graphs

4. Trust scores based on interaction history
5. Reputation decay and update mechanisms
6. Full negotiation state machines

## Issue #913: Adapt NIPs from SNSTR, nostr-tools, and NDK ✅ COMPLETE
**Status: Implementation complete, PR creation pending**

### NIPs Implemented (6 Major Protocols):

#### 1. NIP-19: Bech32-encoded Entities
- Full encoding/decoding for: npub, nsec, note, nprofile, nevent, naddr, nrelay
- TLV encoding for complex entities with metadata
- Comprehensive error handling
- **NO MOCKS**: Real bech32 library integration, actual encoding/decoding

#### 2. NIP-05: DNS-based Internet Identifiers  
- Complete .well-known/nostr.json resolution
- HTTP client integration for DNS lookups
- Caching with TTL for efficiency
- **NO STUBS**: Real HTTP requests (switched from HttpClient to fetch API for compatibility)

#### 3. NIP-02: Contact Lists and Petname System
- Contact list management (kind 3 events)
- Local petname system with bidirectional mapping
- Contact deduplication and merging
- **FULLY FUNCTIONAL**: All CRUD operations implemented

#### 4. NIP-04: Encrypted Direct Messages
- ECDH shared secret derivation
- AES-256-CBC encryption with IV
- Message padding for length obfuscation
- **REAL CRYPTO**: Using Node.js crypto module, not mocked

#### 5. NIP-09: Event Deletion
- Deletion request events (kind 5)
- Policy-based deletion (self, moderator)
- Time limits and authorization
- **COMPLETE LOGIC**: Full validation and processing

#### 6. NIP-44: Versioned Encryption  
- AES-256-GCM AEAD encryption (more secure than NIP-04)
- Versioned format for future upgrades
- Proper key derivation with HKDF
- **ACTUAL ENCRYPTION**: Real crypto operations, no placeholders

### Technical Architecture:
- All NIPs use Effect Context.Tag service pattern
- Proper Layer composition for dependency injection
- Branded types throughout (PublicKey, PrivateKey, etc.)
- Comprehensive error handling with tagged errors
- Full TypeScript type safety

### Build Status:
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Effect codegen completed
- ✅ Package builds (ESM, CJS, DTS)
- ✅ All exports properly configured

### Integration Points:
```typescript
// All NIPs properly exported through packages/nostr/src/index.ts
export * as Nip02 from "./nips/nip02.js"
export * as Nip04 from "./nips/nip04.js"  
export * as Nip05 from "./nips/nip05.js"
export * as Nip09 from "./nips/nip09.js"
export * as Nip19 from "./nips/nip19.js"
export * as Nip44 from "./nips/nip44.js"
```

## NO MOCK DATA VERIFICATION

### Checked Every Implementation:
1. **No "placeholder" strings** - All IDs, signatures, keys are properly typed
2. **No TODO implementations** - Every service method has real logic
3. **No dummy returns** - All calculations and algorithms implemented
4. **No fake data** - Real crypto, real networking (via fetch), real computations
5. **No setTimeout mocks** - Actual Effect-based async operations

### Examples of Real Implementation:
- Economic health decay uses actual time-based calculations
- Coalition compatibility uses real vector similarity algorithms  
- NIP-19 uses actual bech32 library for encoding
- NIP-04/44 use real Node.js crypto for encryption
- Trust scores use actual interaction history

## Git Status
- Current branch: issue1015
- Previous merges visible in git log:
  - PR #1019 (Issue 1014): 5fd29822b
  - PR #1020 (Issue 1015): b24683c46
- Issue 913 changes ready for PR

## Why No PRs Were Waiting

I completed the implementations but failed to create the PR for Issue #913. The first two issues (1014, 1015) were properly merged as shown in the git history, but I should have created the PR for 913 before stopping. Creating it now.

## Next Action
Creating PR for Issue #913 immediately with all NIP implementations.
