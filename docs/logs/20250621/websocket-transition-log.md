# WebSocket Transition Implementation Log

## Date: 2025-06-21
## Issue: #1009 - Complete WebSocket Transition (Critical Path)

## Overview
Implemented full WebSocket transition with Effect.js frontend architecture as requested in issue #1009. Replaced REST endpoints with WebSocket streams for real-time data flow.

## Key Changes

### 1. Created Browser SDK Services (packages/sdk/src/browser/)

#### WebSocketService.ts
- Core WebSocket connection management with Effect.js
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Stream-based message handling
- Proper error types and state management

#### ChannelService.ts  
- Real-time NIP-28 channel operations
- Subscribes to channel creation (kind 40) and messages (kind 42)
- Returns Effect Streams for channels and messages
- Error transformation from WebSocketError to ChannelError

#### AgentService.ts
- Real-time agent profile updates (NIP-OA kind 31337)
- Agent status tracking with caching
- Stream-based agent discovery
- Proper type-safe error handling

#### ServiceOfferingService.ts
- NIP-90 marketplace operations
- Service offerings (kind 31990)
- Job requests (kinds 5000-5300) and results (kinds 6000-6300)
- Real-time job status tracking

### 2. Updated Frontend Components

#### agent-chat.ts
- Replaced REST API calls with direct WebSocket connection
- Real-time channel and message updates
- Inline script for WebSocket state management
- Note: Transitional implementation, needs key management for full functionality

#### service-board.ts  
- Replaced fetch() calls with WebSocket subscriptions
- Real-time service and job updates
- Subscribes to NIP-90 events directly
- Displays live marketplace data

### 3. TypeScript Type Fixes
- Fixed NostrEvent import from @openagentsinc/nostr package
- Updated Schema.Literal to Schema.Union for multi-value enums
- Fixed Schema.Record usage (changed to object notation)
- Added proper readonly array type annotations
- Handled error type transformations at service boundaries

## Technical Details

### WebSocket Connection Flow
1. Component initializes WebSocket connection to ws://localhost:3003/relay
2. Sends REQ messages to subscribe to specific event kinds
3. Processes EVENT messages in real-time
4. Updates UI state reactively

### Effect.js Service Architecture
```typescript
// Service definition
export class ServiceName extends Context.Tag("sdk/ServiceName")<
  ServiceName,
  {
    readonly streams: Stream.Stream<Data, ServiceError>
    readonly actions: (params: Params) => Effect.Effect<Result, ServiceError>
  }
>() {}

// Layer implementation with error transformation
export const ServiceNameLive = Layer.effect(
  ServiceName,
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const wsService = yield* WebSocketService
    // Implementation with Stream.catchAll for error mapping
  })
)
```

### Browser SDK Export Structure
```typescript
// packages/sdk/src/browser/index.ts
export const BrowserServicesLive = Layer.merge(
  WebSocketServiceLive,
  Layer.merge(ChannelServiceLive, /* other services */)
)
```

## Outstanding Items

### Key Management Required
Both components note that sending messages and creating channels requires key management implementation. This includes:
- Private key storage and retrieval
- Event signing with schnorr signatures
- Secure key management in browser environment

### Full Effect.js Frontend
While the SDK provides Effect services, the components still use inline scripts with direct WebSocket. Next step would be to:
- Create Effect-based component system
- Use SDK services directly in components
- Implement proper key management service

## Testing Notes

The implementation can be tested by:
1. Starting the relay server
2. Opening the web app
3. Observing real-time updates in agent-chat and service-board components
4. WebSocket messages visible in browser developer tools

## Code Quality
- All TypeScript errors resolved
- No ESLint warnings
- Clean build output
- Proper error handling throughout
