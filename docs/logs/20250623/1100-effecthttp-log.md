# Effect HttpClient Service Not Found - Fix Log

**Date**: 2025-06-23 11:00  
**Issue**: `Service not found: @effect/platform/HttpClient` errors in local development  
**Status**: UNRESOLVED - Fix not working  

## Problem Summary

User was experiencing crashes in the OpenAgents chat functionality with the error:
```
(FiberFailure) Error: Service not found: @effect/platform/HttpClient
```

The error occurred specifically when posting messages to `/api/conversations/:id/messages`, not in the Cloudflare streaming endpoint as initially suspected.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Initial Misdiagnosis
I initially thought the issue was in the Cloudflare streaming endpoint where we had recently implemented Effect-based streaming. Added `FetchHttpClient.layer` to that endpoint but the error persisted.

### Actual Root Cause
The real issue was in the **conversation API endpoints** and other API routes that use `Effect.runPromise` to parse request bodies. Here's what was happening:

1. **Psionic Framework Setup**: The framework was correctly setting up an Effect HTTP server with `FetchHttpClient.layer` in the global context
2. **Route Handler Isolation**: Individual route handlers that called `Effect.runPromise` were creating isolated Effect execution contexts
3. **Missing Service Context**: When `request.text` or `request.headers` were accessed inside these isolated Effects, they couldn't find the required `HttpClient` service
4. **Service Dependency**: `request.text` internally requires `HttpClient` service from `@effect/platform`

### Technical Deep Dive

The problematic pattern was:
```typescript
const bodyText = await Effect.runPromise(
  Effect.gen(function*() {
    return yield* context.request.text
  }) as Effect.Effect<string, never, never>
)
```

This creates a new Effect execution context without access to the server's layer context, causing the `HttpClient` service lookup to fail.

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Server-Level Fix (Psionic Framework)
**File**: `packages/psionic/src/core/app.ts`
```typescript
// Added FetchHttpClient import
import { FetchHttpClient, HttpMiddleware, HttpRouter, HttpServer } from "@effect/platform"

// Updated server setup to provide HttpClient layer
const HttpLive = pipe(
  HttpServer.serve(HttpMiddleware.logger(router)),
  HttpServer.withLogAddress,
  Layer.provide(
    Layer.merge(
      BunHttpServer.layer({ port, hostname: host }),
      FetchHttpClient.layer  // <- Added this
    )
  )
)
```

### 2. Route Handler Fixes
**Pattern Applied**: Every `Effect.runPromise` call that accesses request properties now explicitly provides `FetchHttpClient.layer`

**Fixed Pattern**:
```typescript
const bodyText = await Effect.runPromise(
  Effect.gen(function*() {
    return yield* context.request.text
  }).pipe(
    Effect.provide(FetchHttpClient.layer)  // <- Added this
  )
)
```

### 3. Files Updated

   - Fixed `createConversationRoute()` - request body parsing
   - Fixed `updateConversation()` - request body parsing  
   - Fixed `addMessageRoute()` - request body parsing

2. **`src/routes/api/cloudflare.ts`**
   - Fixed request body parsing in chat endpoint

3. **`src/routes/api/openrouter.ts`**
   - Fixed API key header extraction (`request.headers`)
   - Fixed request body parsing in chat endpoint

4. **`src/routes/api/markdown.ts`**

#### Core Framework:
7. **`packages/psionic/src/core/app.ts`**
   - Added `FetchHttpClient.layer` to server layer setup
   - Added console logging to verify updated code execution

## Debugging Process

### 1. Initial Confusion
- Error logs showed failure in `/api/conversations/:id/messages` but I initially focused on Cloudflare streaming
- Multiple dev server instances were running old code, masking fixes

### 2. Process Discovery  
- Killed multiple old bun processes that were serving stale code
- Added console logging to verify code updates were being executed
- Traced the exact point of failure to request body parsing

### 3. Service Architecture Understanding
- Realized Effect's service dependency injection requires explicit layer provision
- Understood that `Effect.runPromise` creates isolated execution contexts
- Identified that `request.text` and `request.headers` internally depend on `HttpClient`

### 4. Systematic Fix Application
- Searched for all instances of `request.text` usage across the codebase
- Applied the same fix pattern to every occurrence
- Rebuilt packages to ensure changes propagated

## Key Learnings

### Effect Service Dependencies
- Effect services must be explicitly provided when calling `Effect.runPromise`
- Server-level layer context doesn't automatically propagate to isolated Effect executions
- `@effect/platform` HTTP request methods internally require `HttpClient` service

### Development Environment Issues
- Multiple dev server instances can mask code changes
- Always verify processes are killed and restarted when debugging
- Console logging crucial for verifying code execution in hot-reload environments

### Systematic Debugging Approach
- Start with error location, not assumptions about cause
- Use logging to verify code execution paths
- Apply fixes systematically across all similar patterns

## Next Steps

1. **Verification**: Restart dev server and test conversation functionality
2. **Cleanup**: Remove debug console logs once confirmed working
3. **Documentation**: Update Effect HTTP service usage patterns in codebase docs
4. **Testing**: Ensure all API endpoints work correctly with the new pattern

## Resolution Status

**PENDING VERIFICATION**: All code changes applied, waiting for user to restart dev server and confirm fix works.

The fix addresses the fundamental issue of Effect service context propagation in HTTP request handling. This should resolve all `HttpClient` service not found errors across the application.

# UPDATE: Fix Not Working - 11:01

## Current Status

Despite all the fixes applied, the error persists. The console logs confirm:
1. Our code IS running (we see the log messages)
2. The error still occurs at `request.text`
3. Providing `FetchHttpClient.layer` at the `Effect.runPromise` level is not solving the issue

## Additional Analysis Needed

### Possible Issues:

1. **Wrong Layer Type**: `FetchHttpClient.layer` might not be the correct layer to provide for `@effect/platform/HttpClient`
   - Need to check if there's a different HttpClient layer for server-side contexts
   - `FetchHttpClient` might be for browser/fetch API, not server requests

2. **Request Object Type**: The `context.request` object might not be the right type
   - Need to verify what type `context.request` is
   - It might need a different approach to read the body

3. **Layer Composition Issue**: The way we're providing layers might be incorrect
   - Server-level layer provision might not work as expected
   - Individual route handler layer provision might need different approach

4. **Effect Version Mismatch**: Different packages might be using different Effect versions
   - Check if `@effect/platform` and `effect` versions are compatible
   - Check if psionic is using a different version

5. **HttpServerRequest vs HttpClient**: The error mentions `HttpClient` but we're working with `HttpServerRequest`
   - These might have different service requirements
   - The `request.text` method might be looking for the wrong service

### What We Know:
- The error occurs INSIDE `request.text` 
- Our logging shows the code reaches the point just before the error
- Providing `FetchHttpClient.layer` doesn't help
- The error specifically asks for `@effect/platform/HttpClient`

### Suspicious Points:

1. The error trace shows it's defined at `/httpClient.js:27:41` - need to check what's there
2. The context object structure - what exactly is `context.request`?
3. Why does a server request need an HttpClient to read its own body?

### Next Investigation Steps:

1. **Check HttpServerRequest implementation**: Look at how `request.text` is implemented
2. **Verify Layer Types**: Ensure we're providing the correct layer type
3. **Alternative Body Reading**: Try different methods to read request body
4. **Direct Service Provision**: Try providing the service directly instead of through layers
5. **Effect Platform Version**: Check version compatibility

### Alternative Approaches to Try:

1. **Use Bun's native request handling**: 
   ```typescript
   const body = await context.request.text() // Without Effect
   ```

2. **Use different Effect patterns**:
   ```typescript
   const body = yield* Effect.tryPromise(() => context.request.text())
   ```

3. **Check if request is already an Effect**:
   ```typescript
   // Maybe request.text is already an Effect?
   const body = yield* context.request.text
   ```

### Critical Questions:

1. Is `context.request` an Effect HttpServerRequest or a native Bun Request?
2. Why would reading a request body need an HttpClient service?
3. Is there a mismatch between Psionic's request handling and Effect's expectations?
4. Are we using the right method to read request bodies in Effect HTTP server context?

## Recommendation for Next Agent

The issue appears to be more fundamental than just missing service provision. The next debugging steps should:

1. Inspect the actual type and structure of `context.request`
2. Look at Effect platform documentation for proper server request body reading
3. Check if there's a different pattern for reading bodies in Effect HTTP server context
4. Consider that the entire approach of using `Effect.runPromise` might be wrong for this context
5. Investigate if request body should be read differently in Psionic/Effect integration
