# HttpServerRespondable toResponse Error

**Date**: 2025-06-23 11:45  
**Issue**: TypeError: self[symbol] is not a function in toResponse  
**Status**: INVESTIGATING  

## Error Details

When accessing API routes (/api/config, /api/conversations), we get:
```
TypeError: self[symbol] is not a function. (In 'self[symbol]()', 'self[symbol]' is undefined)
    at toResponse (/Users/christopherdavid/code/openagents/node_modules/.pnpm/@effect+platform@0.84.6_effect@3.16.3/node_modules/@effect/platform/dist/esm/HttpServerRespondable.js:33:28)
```

## Initial Analysis

The error occurs in the HttpServerRespondable module when trying to convert our response to an HTTP response. This suggests:

1. Our route handlers are not returning proper Effect values
2. The symbol being accessed is likely the Effect internal symbol
3. The response object doesn't have the expected Effect structure

## Investigation Steps

### 1. Check Route Handler Return Type

Need to verify what our handlers are actually returning vs what's expected.

### 2. Inspect HttpServerResponse Utilities

Ensure we're using HttpServerResponse.json() correctly.

### 3. Debug the toResponse Function

Understand what symbol it's looking for and why our objects don't have it.

## Root Cause Found

The issue is that our route handlers were using `.pipe(Effect.orDie)` on HttpServerResponse methods. However:

1. HttpServerResponse.json() returns `Effect<HttpServerResponse, Body.HttpBodyError>`
2. When piped through Effect.orDie, it becomes `Effect<HttpServerResponse, never>`
3. This broke the internal Effect structure, causing the symbol error

## Solution Applied

1. Removed `.pipe(Effect.orDie)` from all HttpServerResponse method calls
2. Removed explicit return type annotations from route handlers to let TypeScript infer correct types
3. Updated RouteHandler type to accept `Effect<any, any, any>` 

This allows the natural error types (like HttpBodyError) to flow through the system correctly.
