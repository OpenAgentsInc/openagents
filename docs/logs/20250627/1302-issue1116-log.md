## 📝 Implementation Log

### 1:02 PM - Starting Implementation

**Current Task**: Creating Storybook components for onboarding flow

**Analysis**: Need to create several new components that work together:
- `useScreenSize` hook for screen detection
- `OnboardingOverlayManager` for conditional overlay logic
- `DesktopRequiredOverlay` wrapper for existing component
- `AuthGateOverlay` using FrameAlert + existing onboarding components

**Strategy**: Build in Storybook first to see all states, then integrate into homepage.

### 1:03 PM - Creating useScreenSize Hook

Building screen size detection hook with proper cleanup and throttling.

### 1:05 PM - Building DesktopRequiredOverlay

Wrapping existing DesktopRequired component with proper overlay styling.

### 1:08 PM - Creating AuthGateOverlay

Building auth gate using FrameAlert as background with all onboarding components:
- HeroCallToAction for GitHub sign-in
- AutoPlayingDemoLoop for live demos  
- RecentBuildsStream for social proof
- LiveUsageStats for platform metrics

### 1:12 PM - Building OnboardingOverlayManager

Creating main logic component that conditionally shows overlays based on screen size and auth status.

### 1:15 PM - Creating Storybook Stories

Building comprehensive stories in "Onboarding" category to show all states:
- Mobile state (DesktopRequired)
- Desktop unauthenticated (AuthGate)
- Desktop authenticated (Normal)
- Dynamic resize behavior
- Interactive authentication flow

### 1:25 PM - Storybook Implementation Complete

Successfully created comprehensive Storybook implementation with all onboarding states:

**Stories Created**:
- 📱 Mobile - Desktop Required
- 📱 Tablet - Desktop Required  
- 🖥️ Desktop - Auth Gate
- ✅ Desktop - Authenticated
- 🎮 Interactive Demo (with live controls)
- 📏 Resize Behavior (animated transitions)
- 🔐 Auth Gate Component (isolated)
- 🚫 Desktop Required Component (isolated)
- Playground (full controls)

**Interactive Features**:
- Screen size simulation with preset buttons
- Authentication toggle
- Live resize animation (2-second smooth transitions)
- Demo completion tracking
- Real-time state indicators

### Components  
- [x] `components/onboarding/OnboardingOverlayManager.tsx` - Main logic component
- [x] `components/onboarding/DesktopRequiredOverlay.tsx` - Desktop requirement wrapper
- [x] `components/onboarding/AuthGateOverlay.tsx` - GitHub auth gate with FrameAlert

### Storybook Stories
- [x] `components/onboarding/OnboardingStates.stories.tsx` - All onboarding states
- [x] Category: "Onboarding" in Storybook navigation

## 🎪 Storybook Stories Plan

### Story Structure
```
Onboarding/
├── Onboarding States
│   ├── Mobile - Desktop Required
│   ├── Desktop - Auth Gate  
│   ├── Desktop - Authenticated
│   ├── Interactive Demo
│   └── Resize Behavior
└── Individual Components
    ├── Desktop Required Overlay
    ├── Auth Gate Overlay
    └── Overlay Manager
```

### Interactive Features
- Screen size simulation
- Authentication toggle
- Live resize demonstration
- Component interaction testing

---

## 🔧 Technical Decisions

### Screen Size Detection
- 1024px breakpoint for desktop requirement
- Throttled resize handling for performance
- SSR-safe with proper hydration

### Overlay Hierarchy
- DesktopRequired: z-50 (complete blocking)
- AuthGate: z-40 (backdrop blur)
- Chat Interface: z-10 (visible background)

### Component Architecture
- Conditional rendering based on screen size and auth
- Proper event cleanup and memory management
- Smooth animations and transitions

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### States to Test
1. **Mobile Portrait** (375px) → DesktopRequired
2. **Mobile Landscape** (667px) → DesktopRequired  
3. **Tablet Portrait** (768px) → DesktopRequired
4. **Tablet Landscape** (1024px) → AuthGate (if unauthenticated)
5. **Desktop** (1280px+) → AuthGate or Normal

### Interactive Tests
- Resize across 1024px breakpoint
- Authentication state changes
- Component interaction and cleanup
- Animation performance

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Storybook Implementation
- [ ] All onboarding states visible in Storybook
- [ ] Interactive controls for testing different scenarios
