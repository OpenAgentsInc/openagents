## 📝 Implementation Log

### 1:02 PM - Starting Implementation

**Current Task**: Creating Storybook components for onboarding flow

**Analysis**: Need to create several new components that work together:
- `useScreenSize` hook for screen detection
- `OnboardingOverlayManager` for conditional overlay logic
- `DesktopRequiredOverlay` wrapper for existing component
- `AuthGateOverlay` using FrameAlert + existing onboarding components

**Strategy**: Build in Storybook first to see all states, then integrate into homepage.

### 1:03 PM - Creating useScreenSize Hook

Building screen size detection hook with proper cleanup and throttling.

### 1:05 PM - Building DesktopRequiredOverlay

Wrapping existing DesktopRequired component with proper overlay styling.

### 1:08 PM - Creating AuthGateOverlay

Building auth gate using FrameAlert as background with all onboarding components:
- HeroCallToAction for GitHub sign-in
- AutoPlayingDemoLoop for live demos  
- RecentBuildsStream for social proof
- LiveUsageStats for platform metrics

### 1:12 PM - Building OnboardingOverlayManager

Creating main logic component that conditionally shows overlays based on screen size and auth status.

### 1:15 PM - Creating Storybook Stories

Building comprehensive stories in "Onboarding" category to show all states:
- Mobile state (DesktopRequired)
- Desktop unauthenticated (AuthGate)
- Desktop authenticated (Normal)
- Dynamic resize behavior
- Interactive authentication flow

### 1:25 PM - Storybook Implementation Complete

Successfully created comprehensive Storybook implementation with all onboarding states:

### 1:35 PM - Fixing Storybook Context Issues

**Problem Identified**: Stories failing with "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'startsWith')" error because `LayoutWithFrames` uses `usePathname()` which requires Next.js router context not available in Storybook.

**Solution**: Create Storybook-safe layout component that doesn't depend on Next.js routing.

### 1:40 PM - Storybook Issues Resolved

**Actions Taken**:
- Created `StorybookAppLayout.tsx` - simplified layout without Next.js router dependencies
- Updated all stories to use `StorybookAppLayout` instead of `AppLayout`
- Maintained same visual styling and Arwes theming
- Preserved background effects and animations

**Result**: All onboarding stories should now render properly in Storybook without context errors.

**Stories Created**:
- 📱 Mobile - Desktop Required
- 📱 Tablet - Desktop Required  
- 🖥️ Desktop - Auth Gate
- ✅ Desktop - Authenticated
- 🎮 Interactive Demo (with live controls)
- 📏 Resize Behavior (animated transitions)
- 🔐 Auth Gate Component (isolated)
- 🚫 Desktop Required Component (isolated)
- Playground (full controls)

**Interactive Features**:
- Screen size simulation with preset buttons
- Authentication toggle
- Live resize animation (2-second smooth transitions)
- Demo completion tracking
- Real-time state indicators

## 🎪 Storybook Stories Plan

### Story Structure
```
Onboarding/
├── Onboarding States
│   ├── Mobile - Desktop Required
│   ├── Desktop - Auth Gate  
│   ├── Desktop - Authenticated
│   ├── Interactive Demo
│   └── Resize Behavior

    ├── Desktop Required Overlay
    ├── Auth Gate Overlay
    └── Overlay Manager
```

### Interactive Features
- Screen size simulation
- Authentication toggle
- Live resize demonstration
- Component interaction testing

---

## 🔧 Technical Decisions

### Screen Size Detection
- 1024px breakpoint for desktop requirement
- Throttled resize handling for performance
- SSR-safe with proper hydration

### Overlay Hierarchy
- DesktopRequired: z-50 (complete blocking)
- AuthGate: z-40 (backdrop blur)
- Chat Interface: z-10 (visible background)

### Component Architecture
- Conditional rendering based on screen size and auth
- Proper event cleanup and memory management
- Smooth animations and transitions

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### States to Test
1. **Mobile Portrait** (375px) → DesktopRequired
2. **Mobile Landscape** (667px) → DesktopRequired  
3. **Tablet Portrait** (768px) → DesktopRequired
4. **Tablet Landscape** (1024px) → AuthGate (if unauthenticated)
5. **Desktop** (1280px+) → AuthGate or Normal

### Interactive Tests
- Resize across 1024px breakpoint
- Authentication state changes
- Component interaction and cleanup
- Animation performance

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Storybook Implementation

- **Error boundaries** and graceful fallbacks

### 1:45 PM - TypeScript Error Resolution

**Problem Identified**: AutoPlayingDemoLoop component props mismatch causing compilation failure.

**Error Details**:
```
error TS2322: Type '{ autoStart: boolean; loopDemo: boolean; speed: string; showProgress: boolean; animated: boolean; onDemoComplete: (demo: any) => void; }' is not assignable to type 'IntrinsicAttributes & AutoPlayingDemoLoopProps'.
Property 'autoStart' does not exist on type 'IntrinsicAttributes & AutoPlayingDemoLoopProps'.
```

**Root Cause**: AuthGateOverlay.tsx was passing incorrect props to AutoPlayingDemoLoop component.

**Invalid props being passed**:
- `autoStart={true}` ❌ (doesn't exist)
- `loopDemo={true}` ❌ (doesn't exist)  
- `speed="normal"` ❌ (doesn't exist)
- `showProgress={false}` ❌ (doesn't exist)
- `animated={animated}` ❌ (doesn't exist)

**Actual AutoPlayingDemoLoopProps interface**:
```typescript
export interface AutoPlayingDemoLoopProps {
  demos?: Demo[]
  autoPlayDelay?: number
  demoTransitionDelay?: number
  onDemoChange?: (demo: Demo) => void
  onDemoComplete?: (demo: Demo) => void
  onInteraction?: () => void
  showControls?: boolean
  className?: string
}
```

**Solution Applied**:
Updated AuthGateOverlay.tsx to use correct props:
```typescript
<AutoPlayingDemoLoop
  autoPlayDelay={2000}
  demoTransitionDelay={4000}
  showControls={true}
  onDemoComplete={handleDemoComplete}
  onInteraction={() => console.log('Demo interacted')}
/>
```

**Verification**: 
- ✅ `pnpm check` passes without TypeScript errors
- ✅ All packages build successfully
- ✅ Storybook components ready for testing
