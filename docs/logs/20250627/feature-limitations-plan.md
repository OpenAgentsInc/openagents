# Feature Limitations Plan for Unauthenticated Users

## Date: December 27, 2025
## Strategy: Progressive Feature Unlock

### Overview

With the new mobile-only gating strategy, desktop users get immediate access to core functionality while premium features remain limited until authentication. This plan outlines which features are immediately available vs. requiring login.

## ðŸ’¡ Feature Upgrade Messaging Strategy

### Contextual Hints (Subtle)
```typescript
// Example: In chat interface footer
{!isAuthenticated && (
  <div className="text-xs text-cyan-400/60 text-center py-2">
    ðŸ’¡ Sign in to save your chat history and deploy projects
  </div>
)}
```

### Action-Based Prompts (When User Tries Limited Feature)
```typescript
// Example: When trying to deploy
const handleDeploy = () => {
  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    toast.info(
      "Sign in to deploy", 
      "Create a free account to deploy your project to the web",
      { action: { label: "Sign In", onClick: signIn }}
    )
    return
  }
  // Proceed with deployment
}
```

### Progress Indicators
```typescript
// Example: Feature unlock progress
<div className="border border-cyan-500/30 rounded p-3 mb-4">
  <Text className="text-sm text-cyan-300 mb-2">Unlock More Features</Text>
  <div className="space-y-1 text-xs text-gray-400">
    <div>âœ… Chat with AI</div>
    <div>âœ… Browse templates</div>
    <div>âœ… Edit code</div>
    <div className="text-cyan-400">ðŸ”’ Deploy projects</div>
    <div className="text-cyan-400">ðŸ”’ Save history</div>
  </div>
  <ButtonSimple onClick={signIn} className="mt-2 w-full text-xs">
    Sign In with GitHub
  </ButtonSimple>
</div>
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core Limitations (High Priority)
1. **Chat History Persistence**
   - Location: `components/workspace/WorkspaceChat.tsx`
   - Implementation: Clear messages on page refresh for unauthenticated users
   - UX: Show subtle hint about saving history with login

2. **Project Deployment**
   - Location: Template detail pages, workspace deploy buttons
   - Implementation: Show auth prompt instead of deployment
   - UX: "Sign in to deploy" toast with action button

3. **Save Project Changes**
   - Location: Monaco editor save functionality
   - Implementation: Disable save for unauthenticated users
   - UX: Show "Sign in to save changes" tooltip

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (Medium Priority)
1. **Gallery Submissions**
   - Location: Project workspace, gallery page
   - Implementation: Hide/disable submit buttons for unauthenticated users
   - UX: Show feature as "coming soon" with auth prompt

2. **Real-time Collaboration**
   - Location: Workspace sharing features
   - Implementation: Auth-gate collaboration invite functionality
   - UX: Progressive disclosure of collaboration features

3. **Personal Project Library**
   - Location: Header navigation, project management
   - Implementation: Auth-required routes for personal projects
   - UX: Show "My Projects" with login prompt

### Phase 3: Advanced Analytics (Low Priority)
1. **Usage Tracking**
   - Location: Dashboard/analytics pages
   - Implementation: Anonymous basic tracking, detailed tracking requires auth
   - UX: "Sign in for detailed insights" in analytics UI

2. **Export Features**
   - Location: Project/chat export functionality
   - Implementation: Auth-gate export buttons
   - UX: "Sign in to export" messaging

---

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Patterns

### Authentication Check Hook
```typescript
// hooks/useAuthRequired.ts
export function useAuthRequired() {
  const { isAuthenticated, signIn } = useAuth()
  
  const requireAuth = (action: () => void, message?: string) => {
    if (!isAuthenticated) {
      toast.info(
        "Sign in required",
        message || "This feature requires authentication",
        { action: { label: "Sign In", onClick: signIn }}
      )
      return false
    }
    action()
    return true
  }
  
  return { requireAuth, isAuthenticated }
}
```

### Feature Gate Component
```typescript
// components/FeatureGate.tsx
interface FeatureGateProps {
  feature: string
  fallback?: React.ReactNode
  children: React.ReactNode
}

export function FeatureGate({ feature, fallback, children }: FeatureGateProps) {
  const { isAuthenticated } = useAuth()
  
  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    return fallback || <AuthPrompt feature={feature} />
  }
  
  return <>{children}</>
}
```

### Usage Example
```typescript
// In any component
<FeatureGate 
  feature="project deployment"
  fallback={<AuthPromptButton feature="deploy your projects" />}
>
  <DeployButton onClick={handleDeploy} />
</FeatureGate>
```

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics

### Engagement Metrics
- **Chat Engagement**: % of unauthenticated users who send messages
- **Feature Discovery**: % who explore templates/gallery  
- **Auth Interest**: % who click auth prompts/buttons
- **Time to Auth**: Average time from landing to authentication

### Conversion Funnel
1. **Homepage Visit** â†’ Baseline traffic
2. **Chat Interaction** â†’ % who engage with chat
3. **Feature Exploration** â†’ % who try templates/projects
4. **Auth Prompt Interaction** â†’ % who see upgrade messaging
5. **Authentication** â†’ % who complete GitHub OAuth
6. **Feature Unlock** â†’ % who use premium features post-auth

### Quality Indicators
- **Bounce Rate**: Should remain low despite no forced auth
- **Session Duration**: Should increase with immediate access
- **Auth Completion Rate**: Should be higher (voluntary vs forced)
- **Feature Adoption**: Premium feature usage post-authentication

---

## ðŸŽ¨ UX Design Principles

### 1. Progressive Disclosure
- Show features gradually as users explore
- Don't overwhelm with "sign in" messaging initially
- Let users discover value before highlighting limitations

### 2. Positive Framing
- Focus on what's unlocked rather than what's restricted
- Use upgrade messaging, not blocking language
- Emphasize benefits of authentication vs. feature denial

### 3. Contextual Relevance
- Show auth prompts when users actually need the feature
- Avoid generic "sign in" messages without context
- Provide specific value proposition for each feature

### 4. Seamless Transitions
- Smooth experience when upgrading from guest to authenticated
- Preserve session state through authentication flow
- Continue user workflow after sign-in completion

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### Immediate Implementation
1. Identify specific components that need feature gating
2. Create reusable `FeatureGate` and `useAuthRequired` utilities
3. Implement high-priority limitations (chat history, deployment)
4. Add contextual upgrade messaging throughout the UI

### Future Enhancements
1. A/B testing different limitation strategies
2. Dynamic feature unlock based on user behavior
3. Personalized upgrade prompts based on usage patterns
4. Progressive web app features for authenticated users

### Monitoring & Optimization
1. Track conversion rates at each funnel stage
2. Monitor user feedback on limitation messaging
3. Analyze which features drive authentication most effectively
4. Optimize upgrade prompts based on performance data

## âœ… Implementation Ready

This plan provides a comprehensive framework for implementing feature limitations that balance immediate value with authentication incentives. The strategy prioritizes user experience while creating clear upgrade paths for enhanced functionality.
