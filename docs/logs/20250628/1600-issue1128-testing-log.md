# Issue #1128: Integration Testing Infrastructure - Implementation Log
**Date**: Saturday, June 28, 2025  
**Start Time**: 16:00  
**Branch**: add-integration-tests  
**Purpose**: Add unit tests for chat-to-artifact integration, starting with core hooks and utilities

## Overview

Following the merge of PR #1132 (chat-to-artifact integration), we need to add comprehensive testing to ensure the feature is robust and maintainable. Issue #1128 originally called for integration testing infrastructure, but we're starting with unit tests for the newly added functionality.

## Current Testing Status

### Infrastructure
- ✅ Vitest + React Testing Library configured
- ✅ Test utilities with provider wrappers
- ✅ Basic rendering tests passing
- ❌ Chat flow integration tests skipped (AI SDK mocking issues)
- ❌ No unit tests for artifact functionality

### Priority Components to Test
1. **useArtifactCreation hook** - Core logic for code extraction
2. **ArtifactsContext** - State management
3. **Chat components** - Message handling
4. **API routes** - Chat endpoint

## Implementation Plan

Starting with unit tests for the most critical component: `useArtifactCreation` hook.

---

## 16:00 - Starting Implementation

Creating unit test structure for the artifact creation functionality.

## 16:05 - Unit Tests Created

Created comprehensive unit tests for the core components:

### 1. useArtifactCreation Hook Tests (`__tests__/unit/hooks/useArtifactCreation.test.ts`)
- ✅ Code extraction from various markdown formats
- ✅ Language detection (tsx, jsx, javascript, typescript)
- ✅ Title extraction from code and user messages
- ✅ Description generation from comments and code structure
- ✅ Handling of incomplete components
- ✅ Edge cases (malformed blocks, long code, etc.)
- **Total**: 20 test cases

### 2. ArtifactsContext Tests (`__tests__/unit/artifacts/ArtifactsContext.test.tsx`)
- ✅ Initial state and localStorage loading
- ✅ CRUD operations (add, update, delete)
- ✅ Navigation between artifacts
- ✅ Deployment functionality
- ✅ LocalStorage persistence
- ✅ Error handling for corrupted data
- **Total**: 23 test cases

### 3. WorkspaceChatWithArtifacts Tests (`__tests__/unit/components/WorkspaceChatWithArtifacts.test.tsx`)
- ✅ Message rendering and display
- ✅ User input handling
- ✅ AI response integration
- ✅ Automatic artifact creation from code
- ✅ Error states and retry logic
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts
- **Total**: 14 test cases

## Next Steps

1. Run the tests to ensure they pass
2. Fix any failing tests
3. Add more component tests if needed
4. Work on fixing the AI SDK mocking for integration tests
