# Issue #1134: Tool-Based Artifact Creation Refactor - Implementation Log
**Date**: Saturday, June 28, 2025  
**Start Time**: 17:50  
**Branch**: implement-tool-based-artifacts  
**Purpose**: Refactor artifact creation from brittle regex parsing to robust AI SDK tool calls with XML fallback

## Overview

Implementing a comprehensive refactor of the artifact creation system to address the brittleness of the current `useArtifactCreation` hook. The new system will use:

1. **Vercel AI SDK Tool Calls** - Structured `createArtifact` tool with Zod validation
2. **XML-style parsing** - Fallback for models that don't support tools well  
3. **Claude Artifacts patterns** - Proper criteria for when to create artifacts (>15 lines, self-contained content)
4. **Enhanced system prompt** - Clear guidelines for the AI on artifact creation
5. **Versioning support** - Ability to update existing artifacts instead of always creating new ones

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Tool Definition & Schema (45 minutes)
- [ ] Create tool definition with Zod schema
- [ ] Implement tool execution logic
- [ ] Add artifact criteria validation

### Phase 2: XML Parsing Fallback (30 minutes)  
- [ ] Implement XML artifact tag parser
- [ ] Add robust error handling for malformed XML
- [ ] Test edge cases

### Phase 3: System Prompt Enhancement (15 minutes)
- [ ] Update system prompt with artifact guidelines
- [ ] Add examples and criteria

### Phase 4: Chat Endpoint Integration (45 minutes)
- [ ] Update chat API to use tools
- [ ] Handle tool calls and streaming
- [ ] Integrate XML fallback

### Phase 5: Context Updates (30 minutes)
- [ ] Enhance ArtifactsContext for tool-based creation
- [ ] Support artifact updates vs creation
- [ ] Remove old regex-based logic

### Phase 6: Comprehensive Testing (60 minutes)
- [ ] Unit tests for tool definition and execution
- [ ] Integration tests for AI SDK tool integration
- [ ] XML parsing tests
- [ ] E2E tests for complete workflows

### Phase 7: Cleanup & Documentation (15 minutes)
- [ ] Remove deprecated code
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Final testing

**Total Estimated Time**: 4 hours

## 17:50 - Starting Implementation

Creating branch and setting up implementation structure.

## 18:00 - Research AI SDK Tool Interface

Examined the AI SDK type definitions to understand proper tool structure:

### Key Findings:
- `Tool<PARAMETERS, RESULT>` type requires `parameters` (Zod schema) and optional `description`
- `tool()` function creates tools with `execute` function that returns `PromiseLike<RESULT>`
- `ToolExecutionOptions` provides `toolCallId`, `messages`, and `abortSignal`
- Parameters are typed with `inferParameters<PARAMETERS>` from Zod schema

### Implementation Strategy:
1. Create `createArtifactTool` with Zod schema for parameters
2. Implement execution logic that integrates with ArtifactsContext
3. Add XML parsing fallback for models without tool support
4. Update chat endpoint to use tools with streaming
5. Remove all regex-based logic completely

## 18:05 - Phase 1: Tool Definition & Schema

Creating the core tool definition.

### Completed:
- ✅ Created `createArtifactTool` with comprehensive Zod schema validation
- ✅ Added artifact criteria validation (>15 lines, self-contained content)
- ✅ Created XML parsing fallback for models without tool support
- ✅ Enhanced system prompt with Claude Artifacts-style guidelines
- ✅ Updated chat API endpoint to use tools and handle streaming
- ✅ Enhanced ArtifactsContext with tool-based artifact creation

### Architecture Decisions:
- Tool execution returns validated parameters, client handles artifact creation
- Support both tool calls and XML fallback for maximum compatibility
- Use Claude 3.5 Sonnet for better tool calling support
- Complete replacement of regex-based system (no legacy support)

## 18:30 - Phase 2: Integration & Testing

Need to create client-side integration for handling streamed artifacts and write comprehensive tests.
