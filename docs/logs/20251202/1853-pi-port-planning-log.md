# 1853 Work Log

- Started task planning for pi-mono port; read AGENTS/MechaCoder docs and pi article.

- Added pi-mono porting tasks to .openagents via tasks:create (epic + 27 tasks covering LLM providers, agent runtime, CLI/TUI, sessions, tooling, tests).
- Attempted git commit ("Add pi-mono porting task backlog") but pre-commit hook failed: "Failed to flush bd changes to JSONL" (bd not in use here).
