# 0803 Work Log

- Ran `bun test --coverage --coverage-reporter=lcov` to ensure coverage output is available for the build health report (lcov.info generated).
- Planning to add a build-health generator script, docs page, gitignore entry for coverage, and a CI workflow to run the script and upload the summary.
