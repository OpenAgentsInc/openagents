# $TS Work Log (oa-pi10)

- Implemented richer tool `details` metadata across bash/read/write/ls/find/grep/edit (paths, counts, durations, sizes, etc.).
- Added detail assertions to tool tests (bash, grep, ls, read, write, edit).
- Began fixing baseline typecheck issues in deps update utilities (adjusted optional backup handling).
