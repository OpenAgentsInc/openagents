  - service.ts - TrainerService for benchmark runs
  - 18 tests

  Phase 7: Training Loop (src/learning/)

  - loop.ts - Main training loop with progressive benchmark tiers
  - orchestrator.ts - High-level API for entire learning system
  - 7 tests

  Phase 8-9: Dashboard + Guardrails

  - src/dashboard/ - Progress reporting and visualization
