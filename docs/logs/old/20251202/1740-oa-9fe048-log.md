# 1740 Work Log (oa-9fe048)

Task: oa-9fe048 (openagents-42j.15: convert tool schemas to Effect Schema)
Intent: Confirm tool schemas use effect/Schema, add missing coverage, and close task if already aligned.

## Steps
- Claimed task oa-9fe048 via tasks:next.
- Audited tool schemas (read/write/edit/bash/grep/find/ls) and shared schema utilities; all use effect/Schema already with tests in src/tools/*.test.ts.
- Confirmed LLM provider tooling uses Effect Schema conversions; no code changes required.
- Ran bun test (pass).
- Closed oa-9fe048 as no-op (already compliant).
