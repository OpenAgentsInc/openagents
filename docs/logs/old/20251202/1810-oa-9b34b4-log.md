# 1810 oa-9b34b4 Work Log

Picked task oa-9b34b4. Plan: add gitignore entries for runlog-test-* and tasks-cli-* temp dirs produced by tests; clean existing temp dirs.

- Added patterns to .gitignore for runlog-test-*/ and tasks-cli-*/ to keep test artifacts out of status.
- Removed existing temp dirs with `rm -rf runlog-test-* tasks-cli-*`.
- Ran `bun test` (pass) to confirm no regressions.
- Closed task via tasks:update with closeReason documenting cleanup.
