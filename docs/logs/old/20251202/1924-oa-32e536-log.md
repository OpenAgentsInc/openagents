# 1924 Work Log (oa-32e536)

- Starting task oa-32e536: Port AgentTransport/ProviderTransport with queued injections.
- Added AgentTransport/AgentRunConfig/AgentEvent definitions with QueuedMessage support and provider-backed transport that injects queued messages before user turns.
- Added test ensuring queued LLM messages are prepended to requests (`bun test --filter transport`).
