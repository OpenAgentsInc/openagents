# 1340 Work Log

- Re-ran Playwright suite via bun run e2e:test: all 24 tests passing; confirms harness works when invoked through Playwright runner.
- bun test still failing earlier because it picked up Playwright specs; need to adjust test exclusion and add smoke coverage for HUD-001/002/010/012 (oa-22017b).
- Added Playwright smoke test e2e/tests/smoke/basic-smoke.spec.ts covering HUD-001/002/010/012; updated user story matrix to ✅ for oa-22017b.
- Adjusted bunfig test root to src to keep bun test from running Playwright specs; added minor type fixes in e2e fixtures (ErrorMessage phase, verification_complete output, remove unused).
- Fixed test-server unused var; reran bun run typecheck, bun test, and bun run e2e:test: all green.
