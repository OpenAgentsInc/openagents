# 1933 Work Log (oa-f12045)
- Added `tasks:repair-deps` command to CLI to prune orphan dependencies (supports --dry-run and JSON output, non-json summaries).
- Implemented repair logic using existing orphan detection and wrote integration test covering dry-run behavior and actual repair.
- Next: run typecheck/tests and finish task updates.
