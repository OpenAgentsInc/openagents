# FM Mini Suite Run Analysis - 2248

## Summary
**Pass Rate: 57.1% (4/7)** - Up from 42.9%! Progress.

## What's Working
1. **Repeat detection** - Stops infinite loops on simple tasks
2. **task_complete tool** - FM used it on fm-word-count
3. **Multi-step tasks** - fm-create-and-run did write->run->write perfectly

## Passed Tasks
- `fm-hello-world` (2 turns)
- `fm-append-to-file` (2 turns)
- `fm-create-and-run` (6 turns) - Multi-step success!
- `fm-simple-edit` (2 turns)

## Failed Tasks & Root Causes

### fm-read-and-echo - FM doesn't chain reasoning
```
Turn 1: read_file source.txt -> got content in Previous
Turn 2: read_file source.txt -> repeated, stopped
```
FM saw the content but didn't understand to write it to echo.txt.
**Root cause**: FM doesn't chain "read then use" reasoning.

### fm-list-directory - Partial success, wrong content
FM ran `ls -la`, got output, wrote to listing.txt.
But kept rewriting with truncated/mangled content over 14 turns.
**Root cause**: Output truncation in Previous field (~100 chars) loses data.

### fm-word-count - FM never read the file!
```
Turn 1: write_file count.txt "0"  <- Guessing!
Turn 2-11: Random numbers
Turn 12: task_complete
```
FM just made up numbers without reading document.txt.
**Root cause**: FM doesn't understand multi-step workflows.

## Key Insight
FM doesn't plan ahead. It does whatever seems immediate without understanding:
- "Read X then write X" patterns
- "Count requires reading first"
- Multi-step dependencies

## Potential Fixes
1. **Explicit workflow hints** - Tell FM "Step 1: read, Step 2: use content"
2. **Longer history** - Increase Previous field to preserve content
3. **Accept FM's limitations** - Some tasks may be beyond its capability
