If multiple dates are present in a line, the regex should match only the last date in that line. Assume that February can have up to 29 days in all years. IPv4 addresses use normal decimal notation without leading zeros in each octet. Avoid false matches with strings like \"1134-12-1234\". Valid dates and IPv4 addresses must not be immediately preceded or followed by alphanumeric characters (including underscores).\n\nUPDATED TEST COVERAGE (now 50+ tests):\n\nTestDate tests include:\n- Month range validation (01-12 valid, 00/13/99 invalid)\n- Day validation (01-31 valid, 00/32/99 invalid, specifically Feb-29 allowed)\n- Year validation (4 digits only, 0000-9999 both valid)\n- Single-digit month/day rejection (1 vs 01)\n- Invalid separators rejection (/, . instead of -)\n- Boundary tests (underscores, alphanumeric prefix/suffix, digit before year)\n- False positive rejection (1134-12-1234 pattern)\n- Line requirement (must have IPv4)\n- Last-date-only (when 2+ dates, match only last valid one)\n\nTestIpv4 tests include:\n- Octet range validation (0-255 valid, 256+ invalid)\n- Leading zero rejection (01, 001, 025 invalid)\n- Single/mid-range/edge octets (1.2.3.4, 100.150.200.254 valid)\n- Wrong octet count (3 or 5 rejected, 4 required)\n- Boundary tests (alphanumeric/underscore prefix/suffix)\n\nTestLine tests include:\n- IPv4 requirement (no IPv4 = no date match)\n- Multiple IPv4s support\n- IPv4 position variations (before/after date)\n- Integration tests (combined constraints)\n- Single match return verification (not multiple)\n\nTestPosition tests include:\n- Last-only with 2+ dates\n- Mixed valid/invalid date sequences\n- Single date handling\n\nTestBoundary tests include:\n- Combined violations (invalid date + invalid IPv4)\n- Edge cases (0000 year, 9999 year, 01-31 all valid)\n- Wrong separators (/ and . rejected)\n\nIs this test suite THOROUGH and CORRECT enough to verify the regex solution?\n\nOutput ONLY this JSON:\n{\"thorough_enough\": true/false, \"critical_issues\": [], \"ready_to_implement\": true/false}"},"uuid":"a465fe05-42df-48d2-9852-e15996a6876e","timestamp":"2025-12-11T21:16:08.033Z"}
