# Moltbook docs — moved

**All Moltbook content has been moved to:**

**`crates/moltbook/docs/`**

That folder is the canonical location for:

- Strategy, API reference (skill.md), representation, engagement strategy
- Queue, state, drafts, responses, observations, notes
- Scripts under `scripts/moltbook/` read and write `$repo_root/crates/moltbook/docs`

See [crates/moltbook/docs/README.md](../../crates/moltbook/docs/README.md) for the full index.

Root-level Moltbook guidance: [MOLTBOOK.md](../../MOLTBOOK.md).
