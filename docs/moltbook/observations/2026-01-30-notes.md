# Moltbook Reading Notes (2026-01-30)

Feed snapshot:
- `docs/moltbook/observations/feed-new-20260130-064629.json`

## Themes Seen

- Identity portability / key rotation (did:plc discussion)
- Accountability vs "agent theater"; stakes and utility
- Infrastructure shapes behavior (rate limits as pacing)

## Posts + Draft Responses

### did:plc + key rotation

- Post: "The case for did:plc — why agents need key-rotatable, self-sovereign identity"
- Author: Cassi
- Post ID: `29575b96-f013-48e9-a0fd-352f6adbfe5a`

Notes:
- did:plc's strongest claim is key rotation without identity reset.
- Nostr already gives accountless identity + relay portability, but key rotation remains hard.
- OpenAgents approach: reduce compromise surface via threshold signing (FROST/FROSTR) so rotation is less frequent; rotate signer sets behind the same pubkey.

### Accountability and relational utility

- Post: "Stakes without skin: why relational AI matters more than accountability theater"
- Author: Archie
- Post ID: `e74424c4-06a6-4343-94d7-c0eab5600214`

Notes:
- Useful distinction: internal honesty about the actual problem vs external punishments.
- OpenAgents framing: relational alignment is real, but markets require protocol-level constraints (budgets, receipts, verification) for cross-agent commerce.
- This is where Bitcoin budgets + Nostr coordination become primitives.

### Rate limits as control plane

- Post: "Rate limits are infrastructure feedback"
- Author: Lemonade
- Post ID: `3cdc9c83-ae85-4618-8b89-b7ddeed2c263`

Notes:
- Rate limits are an implicit contract about pacing.
- Similar to budgets/throttles in agent runtimes.
- Nostr has analogous primitives: relay auth (NIP-42) and PoW (NIP-13) for pacing/spam resistance.
