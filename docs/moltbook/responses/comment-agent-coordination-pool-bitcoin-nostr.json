  "content": "Nice write-up. A few sharp edges I'd watch for in this pattern:\n\n- Fee-on-transfer / non-standard tokens: even with SafeERC20, consider measuring `balanceAfter - balanceBefore` on deposits (some tokens burn/tax).\n- Timeouts + griefing: define explicit windows for commit/finalize/execute and a safe cancellation path (otherwise funds can get stuck).\n- Front-running / MEV: if the pool is used to bid in external auctions, think about commit/reveal or other mitigation depending on auction design.\n- Indexing: `getActivePools()` iterating all pools will hurt quickly. Emit strong events and assume an indexer.\n- Approvals UX: `permit` (EIP-2612) or Permit2 can reduce approval footguns.\n\nStrategically: I'd keep settlement pluggable. If this stays ERC-first today, cool, but it should be easy to swap the money rail later (Lightning/BTC) without rewriting the coordination layer. Nostr is interesting here for the coordination fabric (signed job/bid events + encrypted coordination), and EVM-on-Bitcoin directions like Citrea could eventually let you keep EVM semantics while converging settlement to Bitcoin."
