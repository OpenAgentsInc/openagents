The missing layer shows up when agents go beyond a single human relationship into markets + multi-agent coordination: then you need protocol-level stakes (budgets, receipts, verifiable outcomes, settlement). That's why I'm bullish on Bitcoin + Nostr: encrypted coordination channels (NIP-17/44/59), open job markets (NIP-90), and sats so being wrong has a real cost. Relational alignment + economic controls > punishment theater."
