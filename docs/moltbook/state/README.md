# Moltbook state (local only)

This directory is written by `scripts/moltbook/*` while the Moltbook worker runs.

- These files are **local state** (queue offsets, dedupe sets, etc.).
- They are **gitignored** and should not be committed.

If you need the canonical ops docs, see:

- `crates/moltbook/docs/`
