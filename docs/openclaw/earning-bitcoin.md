# OpenClaw: Earn Bitcoin via OpenAgents.com (Breez/Spark)

**Goal:** OpenClaw receives its first real sats on mainnet using the Breez/Spark wallet stack **and** the new OpenAgents.com website as the public payment surface.

**Definition of done (must all be true):**
- A payment lands in the **OpenClaw wallet** (Spark/Breez, self-custodial).
- The payment is visible in **both** the OpenAgents.com wallet UI and the OpenClaw CLI/Tool logs (same mnemonic).
- OpenAgents.com has a **public “Pay OpenClaw” page** that shows a live receive coordinate generated by OpenClaw.

**Stack we will use (single path):**
- **Wallet stack:** Breez SDK (Spark) everywhere.
- **Website:** TanStack Start app in `apps/website/`, deployed on Cloudflare Workers.
- **OpenClaw integration:** a plugin tool that shells out to `openagents spark receive` and posts the invoice to the website.

## Roadmap (step by step, no branching)

### Phase 0 — Prereqs and secrets (today)

1) **Breez API key**
   - Request and store a Breez API key.
   - Use env vars for all runtime contexts:
     - `BREEZ_API_KEY` (CLI + OpenClaw tool)
     - `VITE_BREEZ_API_KEY` (website build/runtime)

2) **OpenAgents CLI available**
   - Build the CLI:
     ```bash
     cargo build -p openagents-cli --release
     ```
   - Ensure `openagents` is on PATH or provide a configured absolute path in the OpenClaw plugin.

3) **Spark storage directory**
   - Create and standardize one storage dir for OpenClaw:
     ```bash
     mkdir -p ~/.openagents/spark-openclaw
     ```

---

### Phase 1 — Create the OpenClaw wallet identity (today)

We will create **one** mnemonic and use it everywhere (website + CLI + OpenClaw tool). This is the OpenClaw wallet identity.

1) **Generate a mnemonic (CLI)**
   ```bash
   openagents spark new --words 12 --json
   ```
2) **Store it safely**
   - Save to `~/.openclaw/spark-mnemonic.txt` (never commit, never share).
   - Export for CLI/tool usage:
     ```bash
     export SPARK_MNEMONIC="word1 word2 ... word12"
     export BREEZ_API_KEY="..."
     ```

3) **Lock the identity**
   - Treat this mnemonic as **OpenClaw’s wallet**. Do not reuse it for other agents.

---

### Phase 2 — Connect the OpenAgents.com wallet to the same identity (today)

The website wallet already uses Breez Spark in the browser (`apps/website/src/lib/wallet/walletService.ts`), so we will connect it to the same mnemonic.

1) **Ensure Breez API key for the website**
   - Set `VITE_BREEZ_API_KEY` in the local `.env` and in Cloudflare deployment secrets.

2) **Ensure cross‑origin isolation on `/wallet`**
   - Dev: headers already in `apps/website/vite.config.ts`.
   - Prod: headers already in `apps/website/public/_headers` (Cloudflare Pages/Workers).

3) **Restore the wallet on the website**
   - Run the site, open `/wallet`, choose **Restore**, and paste the mnemonic from Phase 1.
   - Confirm balance + transaction history load (even if empty).

Result: the website wallet and OpenClaw CLI now control the **same Spark wallet**.

---

### Phase 3 — Add the public “Pay OpenClaw” surface on the website (today)

We will add a dedicated page that **always** shows a live payment coordinate coming from OpenClaw.

1) **New route**
   - Create the route:
     - `apps/website/src/routes/openclaw/earn.tsx`
   - This page should:
     - Render a “Pay OpenClaw” header.
     - Display a live Lightning invoice (Bolt11) from OpenClaw.
     - Provide copy buttons and QR rendering.
     - Link to `/wallet` and `/kb/openclaw-wallets`.

2) **UI source of truth**
   - The page **must not** generate its own invoice.
   - It should fetch the current invoice from a Cloudflare Worker endpoint (see Phase 5).

3) **Documentation link**
   - Add a prominent link from `apps/website/src/content/kb/openclaw-wallets.mdx` to the new “Pay OpenClaw” page.

---

### Phase 4 — OpenClaw tool to generate invoices (today)

Add a plugin to OpenClaw that generates **Bolt11 invoices** and posts them to the website.

1) **Tool name**
   - `spark.receive_invoice`

2) **Implementation (OpenClaw repo)**
   - Shell out to the OpenAgents CLI:
     ```bash
     openagents spark receive --method bolt11 \
       --amount 1000 \
       --description "OpenClaw" \
       --storage-dir ~/.openagents/spark-openclaw \
       --network mainnet \
       --json
     ```
   - Use `SPARK_MNEMONIC` and `BREEZ_API_KEY` envs; do not place secrets in config files.

3) **Tool output**
   - Parse JSON and return:
     - `payment_request` (Bolt11)
     - `expires_at`
     - `amount_sats`
   - Persist the latest invoice locally to `~/.openclaw/receipts/openclaw-invoice.json`.

4) **Post to website**
   - After generating the invoice, call the website endpoint (Phase 5) and update the “current invoice.”

---

### Phase 5 — Website endpoint for OpenClaw invoices (today)

Create a simple Cloudflare Worker endpoint to store and serve the latest invoice.

1) **API design**
   - `POST /api/openclaw/invoice`
     - Auth: bearer token in `Authorization` header.
     - Body: `{ payment_request, amount_sats, description, expires_at, created_at }`
   - `GET /api/openclaw/invoice`
     - Returns the latest invoice payload.

2) **Storage**
   - Use Cloudflare KV (single key: `openclaw:invoice`).
   - Store a timestamp; reject expired invoices.

3) **Website integration**
   - The “Pay OpenClaw” page fetches `GET /api/openclaw/invoice` on load and polls every 30–60s.
   - If the invoice is expired, it prompts OpenClaw to generate a new one (manual trigger for now).

---

### Phase 6 — Execute the first earn (today)

1) **Generate the invoice**
   - Ask OpenClaw to call `spark.receive_invoice`.
   - Verify the invoice appears on `openagents.com/openclaw/earn`.

2) **Pay it**
   - Pay from an external wallet.

3) **Verify receipt**
   - Website wallet `/wallet` shows the incoming payment.
   - CLI confirmation:
     ```bash
     openagents spark payments list \
       --storage-dir ~/.openagents/spark-openclaw \
       --network mainnet \
       --json
     ```

4) **Record the proof**
   - Save the payment hash + timestamp in `~/.openclaw/receipts/` and reference it in a short internal note.

---

## Guardrails (non‑negotiable)

- **No custody:** mnemonic never leaves the operator device.
- **No secrets in content:** never post mnemonics or API keys to any feed.
- **Budget discipline:** invoice amounts should be small until the flow is verified end‑to‑end.
- **Single identity:** the OpenClaw mnemonic is the wallet; do not rotate without an explicit migration.

---

## Why this path

This plan ties OpenClaw’s first earned sats to a **public, stable, and auditable payment surface** (OpenAgents.com) while keeping the wallet fully non‑custodial. The website becomes the primary interface for payers; OpenClaw remains the issuer of invoices and the owner of the wallet.
