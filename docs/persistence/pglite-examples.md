I'll show you how to use PGlite with TypeScript in a non-React environment, which aligns perfectly with your OpenAgents architecture using Elysia/Bun for the backend and server-side rendering.Now let me create an example of how to use this with your Psionic framework and WebTUI components:## Key Points for Non-React PGlite Usage:

### 1. **Server-Side with Bun/Elysia**
- PGlite runs natively in Bun as it's a JavaScript runtime
- Use Effect.js services to wrap PGlite operations
- Integrate directly with your Elysia HTTP handlers
- WebSockets or SSE for real-time updates to clients

### 2. **Browser-Side Without React**
- PGlite works in vanilla JavaScript/TypeScript
- Can be bundled with Vite or used via ES modules
- Use native DOM manipulation or your template system
- SharedWorker pattern for multi-tab support

### 3. **Live Queries Without React**
- PGlite's live queries work with any callback function
- Updates can trigger DOM updates, server pushes, or any custom logic
- No React dependency for the reactive system

### 4. **Integration with Your Stack**
- **Psionic**: Generate HTML on the server with live data
- **WebTUI**: Use semantic attributes for styling
- **Effect.js**: Wrap all PGlite operations in Effect services
- **Hypermedia**: Return HTML fragments for updates

### 5. **Progressive Enhancement**
```typescript
// Start with server-rendered HTML
app.get('/chat', async () => {
  const messages = await getRecentMessages();
  return renderChatPage(messages);
});

// Enhance with client-side PGlite
// - Offline support
// - Instant updates
// - Local search
// - Background sync
```

### 6. **Multi-Tab Architecture Options**

**SharedWorker** (shown above):
- Single PGlite instance across tabs
- Best performance and consistency
- Requires HTTPS in production

**BroadcastChannel**:
```typescript
// Coordinate between tabs
const channel = new BroadcastChannel('openagents-chat');
channel.postMessage({ type: 'message-sent', data: message });
```

**Service Worker**:
- Can intercept requests and serve from PGlite
- Works offline
- More complex setup

The beauty of PGlite is that it's just a JavaScript library - it works anywhere JavaScript runs, with or without frameworks. Your Effect.js service architecture provides the structure while PGlite handles the persistence.
