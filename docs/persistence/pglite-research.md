# Persistence Options for OpenAgents: Local-First Chat with Cloud Sync

## PGlite emerges as the strongest candidate

After analyzing all four options against your requirements for a TypeScript/Bun/Effect chat platform with privacy-preserving local-first architecture, **PGlite stands out as the most compelling solution**. It offers full PostgreSQL capabilities in under 3MB, reactive live queries perfect for chat UIs, and mature ElectricSQL integration for cloud sync.

## Comparative Analysis by Key Criteria

### Local Storage Performance

**PGlite** delivers exceptional performance with sub-0.3ms single-row operations and native support for complex PostgreSQL features. Its reactive live query system enables real-time UI updates without polling, making it ideal for chat applications.

**Bun SQLite** offers impressive raw performance (3-6x faster than alternatives for reads), though real-world benchmarks show the gap is smaller. However, it lacks built-in reactive queries and requires manual change detection for real-time updates.

**Effect-TS SQL SQLite Bun** inherits Bun SQLite's performance characteristics while adding Effect patterns, but doesn't fundamentally solve SQLite's limitations for chat-specific features like full-text search or JSON operations.

**Electric SQL**'s current architecture (v1.0) no longer provides local SQLite storage - it's now a read-only sync engine that streams from Postgres to clients, making it unsuitable for offline-first chat applications.

### Cloud Sync Capabilities

**PGlite** excels with native ElectricSQL integration providing shape-based partial replication, real-time streaming updates, and automatic conflict resolution. The sync mechanism handles network interruptions gracefully and supports offline-first patterns.

**Electric SQL** ironically offers limited value for local-first apps despite being a sync engine. Its new architecture focuses on read-path sync only, requiring separate APIs for writes - a significant limitation for chat applications.

**Bun SQLite** requires third-party solutions like PowerSync, LiteSync, or custom HTTP-based sync. While these work, they add complexity and don't integrate as seamlessly as PGlite's built-in approach.

**Effect-TS SQL SQLite Bun** faces the same sync challenges as raw Bun SQLite, though its Effect integration could help build custom sync layers more elegantly.

### Effect Integration

**Effect-TS SQL SQLite Bun** naturally provides the best Effect integration with built-in service patterns, error handling, and resource management. It wraps database operations in Effect patterns seamlessly.

**PGlite** requires manual Effect wrapping but the integration is straightforward:
```typescript
export class PgliteService extends Effect.Service<PgliteService>()("Pglite", {
  effect: Effect.gen(function* () {
    const client = yield* Effect.tryPromise({
      try: () => PGlite.create('idb://chat-db'),
      catch: (error) => new PgliteError({ cause: error })
    });
    return { client, query };
  })
})
```

Both SQLite options require similar manual wrapping, with Bun SQLite needing more boilerplate due to its synchronous API.

### Type Safety and Developer Experience

**PGlite** shines with excellent TypeScript support, Drizzle ORM integration, and a familiar PostgreSQL development experience. Its support for JSON/JSONB types makes flexible chat message schemas trivial.

**Effect-TS SQL SQLite Bun** provides strong type safety through @effect/schema integration and runtime validation, offering the best developer experience for Effect users.

**Bun SQLite** with Drizzle offers good TypeScript support but lacks PostgreSQL's rich type system and JSON capabilities that benefit chat applications.

**Electric SQL** has regressed significantly - its current version provides minimal type safety compared to its previous incarnation.

### Privacy and Encryption

This is where **SQLite-based solutions face challenges**. Neither Bun SQLite nor Effect-TS SQL SQLite Bun support SQLCipher for encryption at rest, requiring application-level encryption.

**PGlite** also lacks built-in encryption but offers more flexibility through custom serializers and parsers, plus PostgreSQL's rich extension ecosystem provides more options.

**Electric SQL** supports application-level encryption well since it only syncs data, not stores it locally.

### Chat-Specific Features

**PGlite** excels with:
- Native JSON/JSONB for flexible message schemas
- Full-text search with multiple strategies (GIN indexes, pg_trgm, pgvector)
- Live queries for real-time message updates
- Rich extension ecosystem (semantic search via pgvector)

**SQLite solutions** require workarounds for advanced search, lack native JSON operations, and need external tools for features PGlite provides natively.

## Architectural Recommendations

Given your requirements, I recommend a **hybrid approach** using **PGlite as the primary local persistence layer** with **Effect-TS SQL patterns** for service integration:

```typescript
// Combine PGlite's power with Effect's patterns
const MessageServiceLive = Layer.effect(
  MessageService,
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const pg = yield* PgliteService;
    const schema = yield* SchemaService;

    return {
      send: (message) => Effect.gen(function* () {
        // Validate with Effect schema
        const validated = yield* schema.decode(MessageSchema)(message);
        // Store locally with PGlite
        const stored = yield* pg.query(client =>
          client.query('INSERT INTO messages...', [validated])
        );
        // Queue for sync
        yield* SyncQueue.enqueue(stored);
        return stored;
      })
    };
  })
);
```

This architecture provides:
1. **PostgreSQL's power** for complex queries and data types
2. **Effect patterns** for error handling and composability
3. **Local-first operation** with PGlite's embedded database
4. **Seamless cloud sync** via ElectricSQL integration
5. **Type safety** through Effect schemas and Drizzle ORM

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Start with PGlite + Drizzle** for immediate productivity
2. **Wrap with Effect services** for consistent error handling
3. **Implement ElectricSQL sync** for cloud backup
4. **Add pgvector extension** for semantic message search
5. **Layer application-level encryption** for sensitive data

## Migration Strategy

If you need to maintain compatibility or provide a migration path:

```typescript
// Abstraction layer supporting multiple backends
interface ChatPersistence {
  messages: MessageRepository;
  sync: SyncService;
}

// Implement for each backend
class PGlitePersistence implements ChatPersistence { }
class SqlitePersistence implements ChatPersistence { }

// Switch based on configuration
const persistence = config.usePGlite
  ? new PGlitePersistence()
  : new SqlitePersistence();
```

## Performance Optimization Guidelines

### For PGlite
- Enable live queries only for visible conversations
- Use cursor-based pagination for message history
- Implement message archiving for older conversations
- Leverage PostgreSQL's partial indexes for active data

### For SQLite Options
- Enable WAL mode for better concurrency
- Use prepared statements consistently
- Batch message inserts in transactions
- Implement custom change detection for reactivity

## Security Considerations

### Application-Level Encryption Pattern
```typescript
const EncryptedMessageService = pipe(
  MessageService,
  Effect.map(service => ({
    ...service,
    send: (message) => pipe(
      Effect.Do,
      Effect.bind('encrypted', () => encrypt(message.content)),
      Effect.bind('stored', ({ encrypted }) =>
        service.send({ ...message, content: encrypted })
      ),
      Effect.map(({ stored }) => stored)
    )
  }))
);
```

### Key Management
- Derive encryption keys from user credentials
- Store keys in secure device storage
- Implement key rotation for long-term security
- Never sync unencrypted keys to cloud

## Risk Mitigation

The main risks with PGlite are its relative newness (2024 release) and single-connection limitation. Mitigate these by:
- Using the multi-tab worker pattern for shared access
- Implementing connection pooling at the application level
- Maintaining a fallback to Bun SQLite if needed (similar APIs with Drizzle)
