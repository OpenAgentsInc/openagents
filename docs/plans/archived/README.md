# Archived Plans and Historical Design Docs

This directory stores superseded planning/design documents kept for historical context.

Rules:
- Do not treat archived files as canonical implementation guidance.
- Active work must reference documents in `docs/plans/active/`, `docs/codex/`, and applicable ADRs/contracts.
- If an archived file is cited, include a pointer to the current canonical replacement.
