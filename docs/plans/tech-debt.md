# Tech Debt Tracker

This file is a lightweight, repo-wide place to track technical debt that should be paid down continuously.

Guidelines:
- Keep entries small and actionable.
- Prefer linking to an ADR/audit/runbook and an owning surface (`apps/*` or `packages/*`).
- Treat this as a queue for follow-up plans under `docs/plans/active/`.
