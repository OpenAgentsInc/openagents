# Extensions Protocol

Canonical base manifest contract:

- `docs/protocol/extensions/extension-manifest.schema.v1.json`

Use this schema as the base for runtime extension packaging and validation.

Service-specific extension schemas should live beside the owning service code and be linked from that service's docs.
