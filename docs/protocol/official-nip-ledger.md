# Official NIP ledger

`crates/nostr/src/lane.rs` is the ledger for the pinned official lane. The
commit it names is the `official` entry in `nips/manifest.json`. A test
fails when a file under `nips/official/` other than `README.md` has no check.

## What a row proves

NIP-02 is `configured-and-proven`. The domain role is a kind `3` replaceable
list whose `p` tags carry a 32-byte hex key, an optional `ws://` or `wss://`
relay, and an optional petname. The client helpers are `parse_follow_list`,
`append_follow`, and `displayed_petname` in `crates/nostr/src/domain/follow.rs`.
The server role is the ordinary replacement head: `EventClass::from_kind(3)`
is `Replaceable`, so a newer list from the same author deletes the previous
one in `crates/nostr-relay/src/store/mod.rs`. There is no separate setting.
The fixture is the pinned `p` tag triple. Live acceptance is
`lane::tests::nip02_follow_lists_replace_and_petnames_chain`. Content is
ignored, which is what the pinned text says. The `nostr` and `nostr-relay`
crates own the row.

NIP-03 is `configured-and-proven`. `open_attestation` in
`crates/nostr/src/domain/ots.rs` reads a kind `1040` event: one `e` tag, one
`k` tag, and a base64 `.ots` body. The proof digest must be that event id,
and the proof must reach exactly one Bitcoin block-height attestation.
Admission uses the same check. NIP-03 stays off the NIP-11 list because the
pinned text marks it unrecommended. The height is not compared to a Bitcoin
block header. Acceptance is
`domain::ots::tests::a_bitcoin_proof_binds_the_event_id_and_one_height`.

NIP-29 is `configured-and-proven`. The domain role is `GroupMetadata` and
`GroupAction` in `crates/nostr/src/domain/expanded.rs`. The server role is
admission, query filtering, and metadata regeneration in
`crates/nostr-relay/src/store/mod.rs`. Configuration is
`NOSTR_RELAY_RELAY_SECRET_KEY`; NIP-11 then advertises
`nip29.subgroups: true`. The fixture is the pinned metadata event: `private`,
`hidden`, `restricted`, one `parent`, and the child list. Live acceptance is
`domain::expanded::tests::private_hidden_and_subgroup_fields_follow_the_pinned_metadata_event`
and the relay query filter that hides private timeline events and hidden
metadata from non-members. The limitation is that kinds 9003, 9004, 9006, and
9011–9020 have no row in the pinned moderation table, and kind 39004 stays
empty because this process does not run LiveKit. The `nostr` and `nostr-relay`
crates own the row. Its status is distinct from a kind-and-tag check.

Event-shaped files other than NIP-29 are still a `Shape`: the kind and one
tag that occur in the pinned text. That check is partial. It signs an event
with that kind and tag, accepts it, and refuses the same event with the tag
removed. It does not re-state every optional field, and it is not
configured-and-proven.

Files whose body says the rules moved to NIP-01 are not a second protocol.
The check requires that sentence and still verifies a signed NIP-01 event.

The other files call the function that implements them: identifiers,
bech32, encryption, search, expiration, delegation, sync, management method
names, and the browser and Android signer method lists.

## Advertisement

NIP-11 lists a numeric NIP only when the relay runs that path. 77 is listed
because `NEG-OPEN` is handled. OpenAgents profile names stay off that list
until `NOSTR_RELAY_OPENAGENTS_PROFILES` is set.

## Owner

The `nostr` and `nostr-relay` crates own these checks. Live Postgres
acceptance of the gateway remains `crates/nostr-relay/tests/gateway_postgres.rs`
and runs only against a disposable database.
