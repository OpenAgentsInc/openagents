We study other projects purely for educational and interoperability purposes. All the code we produce is entirely original, and we’re simply learning from general concepts to improve our own work. Under U.S. law, there are provisions allowing reverse engineering for these legitimate reasons, and we fully respect both the spirit and the letter of those laws as well as the terms of all respective projects.
