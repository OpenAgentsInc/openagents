# Stellar \[SEP-41 token payments on the Stellar network]

The [Stellar](https://stellar.org) payment method enables payments using SEP-41-compliant tokens on the Stellar network. Stellar supports two intents – **charge** for one-time on-chain transfers and **channel** for high-frequency off-chain payment channels – covering everything from single API calls to metered billing at token-level granularity.

The reference implementation is provided by [`@stellar/mpp`](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-mpp-sdk), which extends [`mppx`](https://github.com/wevm/mppx) with Stellar-native client and server handlers.

## Installation

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
$ npm install @stellar/mpp mppx @stellar/stellar-sdk
```

```bash [pnpm]
$ pnpm add @stellar/mpp mppx @stellar/stellar-sdk
```

```bash [bun]
$ bun add @stellar/mpp mppx @stellar/stellar-sdk
```

:::

## Why Stellar

Stellar enables several useful capabilities for MPP:

* **5-second finality**: Transactions settle with deterministic confirmation, no probabilistic waiting
* **Sub-cent fees**: Transaction costs low enough for micropayments and per-request billing
* **Fee sponsorship**: Servers can pay transaction fees on behalf of clients, removing wallet friction entirely
* **Stellar smart contracts**: Payment channels run as auditable on-chain contracts for secure reserve and settlement
* **Flexible token support**: Any SEP-41 compliant token is supported, which includes smart contract transfers and classic assets (via SAC).
* **Payment channels**: Off-chain cumulative commitments enable high-frequency metered billing without per-request on-chain cost

## Choosing an intent

| | **Charge** | **Channel** |
|---|---|---|
| **Pattern** | One-time payment per request | Deposit once, pay incrementally with commitments |
| **Latency overhead** | ~5s (on-chain confirmation) | Near-zero after channel open |
| **Throughput** | One transaction per request | Many commitments per second per channel |
| **Best for** | Single API calls, content access, one-off purchases | LLM APIs, metered services, usage-based billing |
| **On-chain cost** | Per request | Amortized across many requests |
| **Settlement** | Immediate on-chain token transfer | Off-chain commitments, on-chain close |

## Fee sponsorship

Stellar supports server-paid transaction fees for charge intents. When enabled, the server rebuilds the transaction with its own source account and optionally wraps it in a fee bump. The client signs only the Stellar auth entries – no need to hold XLM for gas.

Pass a `feePayer` configuration to `stellar.charge()` to enable this:

```ts
import { Mppx } from 'mppx/server'
import { stellar } from '@stellar/mpp/charge/server'
import { USDC_SAC_TESTNET } from '@stellar/mpp'
import { Keypair } from '@stellar/stellar-sdk'

const mppx = Mppx.create({
  secretKey: process.env.MPP_SECRET_KEY,
  methods: [
    stellar.charge({
      recipient: process.env.STELLAR_RECIPIENT,
      currency: USDC_SAC_TESTNET,
      network: 'stellar:testnet',
      feePayer: { // [!code hl]
        envelopeSigner: Keypair.fromSecret('S...'), // [!code hl]
      }, // [!code hl]
    }),
  ],
})
```

## Supported assets

Any [SEP-41](https://stellar.org/protocol/sep-41) compliant token is supported. This includes classic Stellar assets wrapped via SAC, as well as custom smart contract tokens that implement the SEP-41 interface. A few common examples:

* **USDC** – Circle's USD stablecoin on Stellar
* **XLM** – Stellar's native asset, wrapped as a SEP-41 token via SAC
* **Any custom SEP-41 token** – smart contracts implementing the SEP-41 token interface

The `@stellar/mpp` package exports constants for commonly used token addresses (`USDC_SAC_MAINNET`, `USDC_SAC_TESTNET`, `XLM_SAC_MAINNET`, `XLM_SAC_TESTNET`).
