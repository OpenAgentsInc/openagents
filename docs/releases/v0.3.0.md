# v0.3.0 — Running Release Notes

Short, user‑visible fixes and improvements landed during this cycle. This file is updated incrementally as changes ship via OTA.

## Fixes & Improvements

- Deep link pairing flows
  - Auto‑connect and skip onboarding when opened from a QR deep link.
  - Full‑screen black overlay (“Pairing”) until navigation settles — removes homepage flicker.
  - Reliable auto‑advance to target screen once connected.
- Onboarding
  - Shows a clear “Pairing” loader while connecting (no other UI).
- Scanner UX
  - Invalid QR now shows an error and stops auto‑reopening the scanner.
- Auto‑reconnect
  - Try once on app start to reconnect using saved host/token.
- Settings
  - Simplified connection section: only Connect/Disconnect shown (host/token/endpoint hidden).
  - New toggle: “Auto‑check every 5s” for OTA updates (optional periodic polling).
- Drawer
  - Provider badges (Codex / Claude Code) use a subtler quaternary color.
  - Timestamp of the last message shown inline with provider, same color (e.g., “• ⏱ 5 minutes ago”).
  - Fixed timestamp mapping to read Tinyvex `updated_at`/`created_at` fields.
- Header / Drawer tap reliability
  - First tap now opens the drawer consistently (haptic on press, better retention; removed shifting margin).
- OTA UX
  - Full‑screen “Updating” overlay during update application.
  - App restores to the last screen visited (e.g., Settings) after OTA reloads.
