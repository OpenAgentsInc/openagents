# ARC Prize 2025 Paper Award Winners

These winners were announced alongside the \$75k ARC Prize pool. Each paper is fresh, so we should pull the text (arXiv or the official ARC Prize announcement), summarize it in `docs/research/paper-summaries/<slug>-summary.md`, and capture why it matters for building archivist/memory/agent work.

| Paper | Year | URL | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Less is More: Recursive Reasoning with Tiny Networks (TRM) – A. Jolicoeur-Martineau | 2025 | https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04871 | HIGH |
| Self-Improving Language Models for Evolutionary Program Synthesis: A Case Study on ARC-AGI (SOAR) – J. Pourcel et al. | 2025 | https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14172 | HIGH |
| ARC-AGI Without Pretraining – I. Liao et al. | 2025 | - | MEDIUM |

## Notes

- TRM won the \$50k first prize; its tiny recursive reasoning network looks like a promising baseline for learning with strict compute/bandwidth budgets.
- SOAR took \$20k for its evolutionary program synthesis + self-improvement loop; capture the interplay between search loops and LLM fine-tuning for ARC-AGI.
- ARC-AGI Without Pretraining got the \$5k prize; the authors claim the ARC-AGI benchmark can be solved end-to-end without a pre-trained base model, so we should verify the training setup and data sources.

Please register each row as a pending paper and create a research task so we can ingest the PDFs/summaries and file the takeaways.
