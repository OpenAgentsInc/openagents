# Integration Testing Challenges: Research Document

**Date**: 2025-06-28  
**Context**: Setting up integration testing infrastructure for OpenAgents chat functionality  
**Status**: Infrastructure established, but facing complex mocking and CI environment issues  

## Current Situation

### ✅ **Achievements**
- Complete testing infrastructure setup (Vitest, React Testing Library, jsdom)
- TypeScript configuration with proper globals
- Provider wrapping system for realistic component testing
- Test utilities and helper functions
- 9 comprehensive integration test scenarios written

### ❌ **Blocking Issues**
All 9 tests are failing due to fundamental mocking and environment challenges that require expert research.

## Core Technical Challenges

### 1. **AI SDK useChat Hook Mocking**

**Problem**: The `useChat` hook from `ai/react` has complex internal state management that's extremely difficult to mock properly.

**Current Attempts**:
```typescript
// Attempt 1: Fetch-level mocking - caused streaming format errors
// Attempt 2: Hook-level mocking with static state - components don't re-render
// Attempt 3: Dynamic mock with shared state - state updates don't trigger re-renders
```

**Specific Issues**:
- Mock state changes don't trigger React component re-renders
- `input` value in textarea doesn't update when mock state changes
- Button disabled/enabled states don't respond to mock input changes
- handleInputChange and handleSubmit aren't properly connected to component state

**AI SDK Integration Complexity**:
- Streaming responses with specific format requirements
- Internal state management for loading, error, and message states
- Complex configuration options (onFinish, onError, initialMessages)
- Integration with Next.js App Router and SSR

### 2. **React Component State Integration**

**Problem**: Mocked hooks aren't properly integrated with React's rendering cycle.

**Symptoms**:
```typescript
// Test expectation
expect(textInput).toHaveValue(testMessage)
// Actual result: empty string ""

// Mock state shows correct value, but component doesn't reflect it
mockChatState.input = "test message" // ✓ Set correctly
textInput.value // ❌ Still empty
```

**Possible Causes**:
- Mock returning static object references instead of fresh values on each render
- React not detecting state changes in mocked hooks
- Missing useEffect dependencies or state synchronization
- Mocking happening at wrong level (module vs runtime)

### 3. **Test Environment Isolation Issues**

**Problem**: Tests interfere with each other and behave differently in CI vs local environment.

**CI vs Local Differences**:
```bash
# Local Environment
✅ 4/4 tests passing (before expansion)
✅ Component renders correctly
✅ User interactions work

# CI Environment  
❌ Multiple element selection errors
❌ "Element could not be focused" errors
❌ Components rendering multiple times
❌ Different DOM structure
```

**Multiple Component Instance Issues**:
- `Found multiple elements with the placeholder text`
- `Found multiple elements with the role "button"`
- Container-based queries still finding multiple elements
- Components not properly isolated between tests

### 4. **User Event Simulation Problems**

**Problem**: `@testing-library/user-event` behaves inconsistently across environments.

**Errors**:
```
Error: The element to be cleared could not be focused.
```

**Current Workarounds**:
```typescript
try {
  await user.clear(input)
} catch (error) {
  if (input instanceof HTMLTextAreaElement) {
    input.value = ''
  }
}
```

**Issues**:
- Elements not properly focusable in test environment
- Textarea interactions failing in CI
- User events not triggering proper React synthetic events

## Research Tasks for Expert Agent

### **High Priority Research**

#### 1. **AI SDK Testing Best Practices**
**Research Goal**: Find authoritative patterns for testing applications that use `ai/react` useChat hook.

**Specific Questions**:
- How do other projects test components that use `useChat` from `ai/react`?
- Are there official testing utilities or recommended mocking strategies?
- What's the proper way to mock streaming AI responses?
- Should we test at the component level or create integration tests with real API calls?

**Research Sources**:
- Vercel AI SDK documentation and examples
- GitHub repositories using AI SDK with tests
- Community discussions on testing streaming AI applications
- Official Vercel/AI SDK testing guides

#### 2. **React Hook Mocking Deep Dive**
**Research Goal**: Solve the re-rendering issue with mocked hooks.

**Specific Questions**:
- Why don't React components re-render when mock hook state changes?
- How to create mocks that trigger proper React rendering cycles?
- Best practices for mocking complex stateful hooks?
- Should we use jest.mock, vi.mock, or MSW for hook mocking?

**Research Areas**:
- React Testing Library best practices for hook mocking
- Vitest-specific mocking patterns for React hooks
- React 19 specific testing considerations
- State management and re-rendering in test environments

#### 3. **CI Environment Debugging**
**Research Goal**: Understand and fix the CI vs local environment differences.

**Specific Questions**:
- Why do tests pass locally but fail in CI with identical code?
- Common causes of DOM structure differences between environments?
- How to debug test failures in CI environments?
- Best practices for test environment parity?

**Investigation Tasks**:
- Compare DOM snapshots between local and CI environments
- Analyze differences in React rendering behavior
- Check for timing/race condition issues in CI
- Review Node.js version, dependencies, and environment variables

### **Medium Priority Research**

#### 4. **Alternative Testing Strategies**
**Research Goal**: Explore different approaches to testing chat functionality.

**Options to Investigate**:
- **E2E Testing**: Use Playwright/Cypress instead of unit/integration tests
- **Mock Service Worker (MSW)**: Test with real API calls to mocked endpoints
- **Component Isolation**: Test individual parts separately instead of full integration
- **Real Backend Testing**: Spin up test backend for integration tests

#### 5. **Test Architecture Patterns**
**Research Goal**: Find proven patterns for testing complex interactive applications.

**Areas to Research**:
- Page Object Model patterns for complex UI testing
- Test data management and state isolation
- Async operation testing best practices
- Provider and context testing patterns

### **Low Priority Research**

#### 6. **Performance and Reliability**

4. **Component Testing**: Test form inputs, buttons, and UI behavior separately

### **Success Criteria**
- [ ] At least 5/9 integration tests passing consistently
- [ ] Tests pass in both local and CI environments  
- [ ] No mocking-related console errors
- [ ] Reliable test execution (< 5% flakiness)
