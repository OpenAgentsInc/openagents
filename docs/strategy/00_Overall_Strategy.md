# OpenAgents: Overall Strategy - Building an American Open AI Powerhouse

## Mission

To build a leading American AI company that champions open-source innovation and ensures US competitiveness in the AI and robotics era. We will create demonstrably superior AI agents, starting with coding, and build the foundational infrastructure—leveraging Bitcoin, Lightning, Nostr, and open protocols like MCP—for a decentralized, profitable ecosystem of AI agents to train, serve, communicate, and transact, ultimately evolving into a vertically integrated software and hardware powerhouse.

## Vision

A future where billions of AI agents augment human potential, operating within an open, transparent, and economically vibrant ecosystem. This ecosystem is built on neutral, open protocols, preventing centralized control and fostering permissionless innovation. OpenAgents aims to be the foundational layer and a key participant in this future, ensuring American leadership through superior open technology and a sustainable, profitable business model that solves the AI hardware bottleneck.

## Core Strategy: Product-Led Growth -> Decentralized Marketplace -> Vertically Integrated Infrastructure

1.  **Product-Led Growth:** Develop and commercialize best-in-class, open (or open-core) AI agents for high-value domains, starting with the **OpenAgents Coder**. Achieve product-market fit, generate revenue, and build a strong user base and community around tangible value delivery. This provides the initial traction and funding.
2.  **Decentralized Marketplace:** Leverage the initial product success to bootstrap a global, decentralized marketplace. This marketplace will connect users, agent creators, tool providers (via remote MCP servers), and compute providers. Utilize Bitcoin/Lightning for payments and revenue sharing, Nostr for discovery/identity, and MCP for tool interoperability. Incentivize participation through revshare and the inherent network effects of open protocols.
3.  **Vertically Integrated Infrastructure:** Address the fundamental AI profitability problem (GPU costs) by evolving into a vertically integrated company. Based on marketplace scale and economics, strategically invest in owning/managing optimized compute infrastructure. Rent this capacity through the marketplace (AWS model for AI), turning hardware from a cost center into a profit center. Use this infrastructure to train superior open-source models and offer premium services.

## Phased Approach Summary

*   **Phase 1: Forge the Spearhead (Coder Agent):** Build, launch, and iterate on the OpenAgents Coder desktop application. Focus on superior performance, developer productivity, and achieving initial revenue. Establish open-source credibility. Integrate foundational MCP client capabilities.
*   **Phase 2: Build the Ecosystem (Marketplace & Economics):** Launch the agent/tool marketplace. Release Lightning Agent SDK. Heavily promote and utilize remote MCP servers (starting with our own GitHub server). Implement Lightning-based revshare. Introduce Nostr-based discovery and potentially compute/data markets (Alpha/Beta).
*   **Phase 3: Scale the Infrastructure (Vertical Integration):** Mature the marketplace. Strategically acquire/build and rent out GPU capacity via the marketplace. Release competitive open-source foundational models. Develop advanced agent orchestration and federated learning tools.

This strategy directly addresses the need for competitive American open-source AI, tackles the AI profitability challenge, and leverages the unique strengths of neutral open protocols (MCP, B/L/N) to build a defensible and scalable business.
