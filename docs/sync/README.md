# Sync Docs

Khala sync documentation and runbooks:
- `thoughts.md`: architecture and invariants
- `ROADMAP.md`: migration and implementation sequencing
- `SURFACES.md`: client/topic surface contract
- `RUNTIME_CODEX_CUTOVER_RUNBOOK.md`: rollout/cutover procedure
- `PARITY_DASHBOARD.md`: parity and drift visibility model

Historical rollout snapshots live under `status/` and may reference removed legacy surfaces; treat them as historical records, not canonical current-surface guidance.
