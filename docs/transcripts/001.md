## Full Transcript

Hey folks, in this video series we're going to build an open platform for AI agents, mostly from scratch, and connected to our already built open network of GPUs. Why agents? Well, it became clear from OpenAI's DevDay yesterday that they view agents as the future, and they want to own it, along with Microsoft. And we don't think the future of AI should be owned by these closed source mega-corpbs with the history of monopolization and regulatory capture. If you remember from our last video, where did I put it? Yeah, we did a previous video series kind of going into why we need a truly open version of what OpenAI is producing. So yeah, we're going to continue that thought in this series. Now, so we're going to build an open version of an agent's platform. That means all open source with open models, open data sets, open money, Bitcoin, open compute, open everything. We've got a little bit of code already done for this, but we're going to pull it over into this new repo that's open source, HTTP3. And we're going to kind of document things here as we go, so it's easy to follow along because we want to invite people from the community to contribute. And we're going to be realigning our Bitcoin bounty pool. We've got most of the, we've awarded some of these, but we've still got about 100 grand worth of Bitcoin bounties ready that we're going to incentivize developers to help. And so making things really clear and simple and easy to follow along will be important. So we've got a wiki with a little bit of initial information here. You can read about our principles. We want to ship early and often. We want to generate and share revenue. We're going to use Bitcoin where it's helpful. We're not going to do any crypto shit coin distracting bullshit. And we're going to build for users. We have a wait list up and I just collected a few of the answers that people have provided from the wait list so far. How do you want to use AI agents for programming, for trading and financial analysis, doing keyword research writing articles, maintain my client's WordPress websites, collecting and optimizing data for model training. So we want to build in the direction of enabling all of these users to get their needs met through this agents dashboard that we are going to create together in this series. So follow along, join our discord if you want to chat about any of this. And we'll see you soon.

[0:00 - 0:05] Hey folks, in this video series we're going to build an open platform for AI agents,

[0:05 - 0:12] mostly from scratch, and connected to our already built open network of GPUs.

[0:13 - 0:14] Why agents?

[0:14 - 0:20] Well, it became clear from OpenAI's DevDay yesterday that they view agents as the future,

[0:20 - 0:23] and they want to own it, along with Microsoft.

[0:25 - 0:31] And we don't think the future of AI should be owned by these closed source

[0:31 - 0:35] mega-corpbs with the history of monopolization and regulatory capture.

[0:36 - 0:41] If you remember from our last video, where did I put it?

[0:42 - 0:46] Yeah, we did a previous video series kind of going into why we need a truly open version

[0:46 - 0:47] of what OpenAI is producing.

[0:47 - 0:50] So yeah, we're going to continue that thought in this series.

[0:50 - 0:54] Now, so we're going to build an open version of an agent's platform.

[0:54 - 1:00] That means all open source with open models, open data sets, open money, Bitcoin, open

[1:00 - 1:02] compute, open everything.

[1:02 - 1:07] We've got a little bit of code already done for this, but we're going to pull it over

[1:07 - 1:09] into this new repo that's open source, HTTP3.

[1:11 - 1:15] And we're going to kind of document things here as we go, so it's easy to follow along

[1:15 - 1:18] because we want to invite people from the community to contribute.

[1:18 - 1:23] And we're going to be realigning our Bitcoin bounty pool.

[1:24 - 1:27] We've got most of the, we've awarded some of these, but we've still got about 100 grand

[1:27 - 1:33] worth of Bitcoin bounties ready that we're going to incentivize developers to help.

[1:33 - 1:37] And so making things really clear and simple and easy to follow along will be important.

[1:38 - 1:41] So we've got a wiki with a little bit of initial information here.

[1:41 - 1:43] You can read about our principles.

[1:43 - 1:44] We want to ship early and often.

[1:45 - 1:46] We want to generate and share revenue.

[1:47 - 1:49] We're going to use Bitcoin where it's helpful.

[1:49 - 1:51] We're not going to do any crypto shit coin distracting bullshit.

[1:53 - 1:55] And we're going to build for users.

[1:56 - 2:01] We have a wait list up and I just collected a few of the answers that people have provided

[2:01 - 2:03] from the wait list so far.

[2:03 - 2:07] How do you want to use AI agents for programming, for trading and financial analysis,

[2:08 - 2:11] doing keyword research writing articles, maintain my client's WordPress websites,

[2:12 - 2:13] collecting and optimizing data for model training.

[2:14 - 2:19] So we want to build in the direction of enabling all of these users to get their needs met

[2:19 - 2:22] through this agents dashboard that we are going to create together in this series.

[2:23 - 2:29] So follow along, join our discord if you want to chat about any of this.

[2:30 - 2:31] And we'll see you soon.
