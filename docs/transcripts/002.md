Okay, if this is how we want to build the project, what should our text act be? One option would be to do this as a desktop app, using something like towering with a front end in React and embedded backend in Rust. That would give us access to the users GPUs and be able to do cool things with that. Part of me wants to go that route, but if the priorities are to ship early and often and make it as easy as possible to collect feedback from users to make sure we're building the right thing, then a web app probably is best given also that we want this to be sort of a drop-in replacement for or at least users to have the same form factor as what OpenAI is building and they're building everything on the web and then later adding mobile support. So let's do a web app. I think that makes the most sense at least for now. So this OpenAgence website here, or GitHub repo, will have the code for a web app. And what should we use? I think chat GPT uses next JS and the logical place for hosting, I don't know if they're hosted on Versel, but usually there's Versels where people are hosting next JS apps. And that's an option. The GPU Topio website currently uses Versel. But I've been kind of frustrated with that. The server actions and some of the newer edge function stuff has been kind of confusing and they're like kind of explicitly now starting to borrow patterns from PHP. So... Maybe we should just use PHP. Here's an example of levels top AI indie hacker making a bunch of MRR with just a single file for PHP. So I wanted to be more maintainable than that. And it just so happens that I happen to have the most experience personally with Laravel, which is the top PHP web framework, according to me, and I don't know, it's the most popular, I think. This also is what I've started building the previous agents website it. And we're going to pull the other code from this into our new repo. Well, I want to start it from scratch so you can kind of follow along. So I was making a couple of notes here about what the stack is going to be. And I'm going to start with the code. So we'll call this text stack. We're going to use Laravel. Laravel gives you a choice of using either their front end templating language called blade or using a front end framework. And we are going to use a front end framework. The offer support for React or View. I think maybe Svelte. Again, I'm most familiar with React. That matters. And also a bunch of open source AI code seems to be written more in React than other things. So I think that's logical as well as I'd like to use those shared UI components. Although I guess those are for more frameworks than just React. Or maybe not. I think it's just React. Okay, so Laravel React. There's a official project that kind of glues inertia. A glues Laravel together with React called inertia. I'm also using that in that agent's site. Yeah. Server driven web app, modern monolith. Create fully client side rendered single page apps without the complexity to come with modern single page apps. Leveraging existing server side patterns that you already love. Fine tune for Laravel. What else? We are definitely going to use tailwind for CSS. These days when you start up a Laravel app with inertia, it's like the components are already built for you in tailwind CSS. Anything else we need to choose? For database, Laravel generally works with my SQL. I think it might be worth trying to use. I think it also works well with Postgres. We might want Postgres for PG Vector. Are we going to want to host our own embeddings on our local database? For now, I'll just put my SQL or Postgres. We want to start with one and upgrade to the other later. We need to see what our hosting environment supports. Anything else? We want to use to make it as easy as possible for component development. We're just going to use Chat UI components to build up our interfaces. Okay. We'll call that our text stack. We can always evolve this later on. In the next video, we will set up our Laravel project.

[00:00 - 00:05] Okay, if this is how we want to build the project,
[00:06 - 00:08] what should our text act be?
[00:09 - 00:12] One option would be to do this as a desktop app,
[00:12 - 00:16] using something like towering with a front end in React
[00:16 - 00:20] and embedded backend in Rust.
[00:20 - 00:23] That would give us access to the users GPUs
[00:23 - 00:25] and be able to do cool things with that.
[00:27 - 00:28] Part of me wants to go that route,
[00:28 - 00:32] but if the priorities are to ship early and often
[00:32 - 00:35] and make it as easy as possible to collect feedback
[00:35 - 00:37] from users to make sure we're building the right thing,
[00:37 - 00:40] then a web app probably is best given also
[00:40 - 00:43] that we want this to be sort of a drop-in replacement
[00:43 - 00:47] for or at least users to have the same form factor
[00:47 - 00:48] as what OpenAI is building
[00:48 - 00:50] and they're building everything on the web
[00:50 - 00:52] and then later adding mobile support.
[00:53 - 00:55] So let's do a web app.
[00:55 - 00:58] I think that makes the most sense at least for now.
[00:59 - 01:04] So this OpenAgence website here,
[01:04 - 01:08] or GitHub repo, will have the code for a web app.
[01:09 - 01:11] And what should we use?
[01:11 - 01:15] I think chat GPT uses next JS
[01:15 - 01:16] and the logical place for hosting,
[01:16 - 01:17] I don't know if they're hosted on Versel,
[01:17 - 01:22] but usually there's Versels where people are hosting
[01:23 - 01:24] next JS apps.
[01:25 - 01:26] And that's an option.
[01:27 - 01:32] The GPU Topio website currently uses Versel.
[01:34 - 01:36] But I've been kind of frustrated with that.
[01:36 - 01:41] The server actions and some of the newer edge function stuff
[01:41 - 01:43] has been kind of confusing
[01:43 - 01:47] and they're like kind of explicitly now starting to borrow
[01:47 - 01:49] patterns from PHP.
[01:49 - 01:50] So...
[01:51 - 01:54] Maybe we should just use PHP.
[01:56 - 01:59] Here's an example of levels top AI indie hacker
[01:59 - 02:05] making a bunch of MRR with just a single file for PHP.
[02:06 - 02:10] So I wanted to be more maintainable than that.
[02:10 - 02:14] And it just so happens that I happen to have the most

[02:20 - 02:22] according to me, and I don't know,
[02:22 - 02:24] it's the most popular, I think.
[02:24 - 02:27] This also is what I've started building the previous agents
[02:27 - 02:28] website it.
[02:28 - 02:33] And we're going to pull the other code from this into our new repo.
[02:33 - 02:37] Well, I want to start it from scratch so you can kind of follow along.

[02:49 - 02:51] We're going to use Laravel.
[02:51 - 02:56] Laravel gives you a choice of using either their front end
[02:56 - 03:02] templating language called blade or using a front end framework.
[03:02 - 03:05] And we are going to use a front end framework.
[03:07 - 03:10] The offer support for React or View.
[03:10 - 03:12] I think maybe Svelte.
[03:12 - 03:15] Again, I'm most familiar with React.

[03:50 - 03:55] I'm also using that in that agent's site.
[03:55 - 03:57] Yeah.
[03:57 - 04:00] Server driven web app, modern monolith.
[04:00 - 04:05] Create fully client side rendered single page apps without the complexity to come with modern single page apps.
[04:05 - 04:10] Leveraging existing server side patterns that you already love.

[04:38 - 04:46] For database, Laravel generally works with my SQL.
[04:46 - 04:51] I think it might be worth trying to use.
[04:51 - 04:56] I think it also works well with Postgres.
