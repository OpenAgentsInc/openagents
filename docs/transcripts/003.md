## Full Transcript

Alright, let's step through creating our Laravel project. We'll do this slowly and it's cool for new people to learn Laravel. So, Laravel.com docs installation, your first Laravel project. Now, I want to start an inertia project. I don't actually think I want to do these instructions or do I? So, maybe we should follow the inertia instructions. Alright, the first step when installing inertia is to configure your server side framework. Laravel's starter kits provide out of the box scaffolding for new inertia applications. That's what we want. These starter kits are the absolute fastest way to start building a new inertia project using Laravel and View or React. If you'd like to manually install inertia in your application, please can sell it out. Let's do a starter kit. Okay, here we go. Wow, they even got breeze and next JS slash API. We're not going to do that. Alright, so breeze and React looks good. Let's read about it first. To give you a head start building your new Laravel application, we are happy to offer authentication and application starter kits. These kits automatically scaffold your application with the routes, controllers, and views you need to register and authenticate your application users. You're not, they're not required blah, blah, blah. So, Laravel breeze is a minimal simple implementation of all of Laravel's authentication features, including login, registration, password reset, email verification, and password confirmation. In addition, breeze includes a simple profile page where the user may update their name, email address, and password. Sounds good. The default view layer is made of a simple blade template, start with tailwind. Additionally, breeze provides scaffolding options based on live wire or inertia. We're going to use inertia. Okay, we want to do breeze and react. So, I guess I should do this first. First, you should create a new Laravel application, configure your database, and run your database migrations. Once you have created a new Laravel application, you may install breeze using Composer. Okay. So, we do want to go through the instructions here. And we're going to need to copy, paste it into our new agents folder. So, let's start with this. Composer create project, Laravel Laravel. What I may actually do is go into the open agents folder and then create that there. And then we'll move it up one directory. Okay. Now, let's take a look at what we have. Okay. All right. So, before we do anything, let's commit that. Conceivably, we can keep it in that directory. But that might introduce some other weird stuff. Oops. Okay. And then we'll move all of this up one directory. Renaming readmates or readme Laravel. And deleting that. Move. Laravel project to rooter. Okay. Let's see what that looks like on our repo. So, we've got the Laravel readme there. Okay. Let's continue down. All right. So, let's see if this works PHP artisan serve. Server running on local host 8,000. And there it is. If you are new to Laravel and want to learn it, I highly recommend this Laracasts website. I signed up for the annual subscription a long time ago. It's just simply one of this, probably the single best developer education resource I've used in my past years. Great, great content. Cool. So, that's the homepage. We'll swap that out soon. Let's continue with the breeze installation. I don't use the Docker version there. Are we done with that part of it? All right. We still need to configure our database. Because if right now I go. Run the migration command, PHP artisan migrate, it should say. Oh, it doesn't exist. Okay. DB connection equals my sequel. All right. So, first of all, the reason that it's able to even connect to a database is because I have DB engine running. This is kind of the recommended way. It's on the website somewhere for spinning up a little. My sequel or sequel database locally. I don't know if this works on windows or whatever. Sorry, I don't care about windows. I'm going to stop this. And I'm going to try. I want to see if I can configure postgres while we're at it. So let's do in DB engine. We do new postgres. And this is postgres 15, the latest version. I don't know anything about the different versions. We'll just try the most recent version. And I did confirm that our hosting environment that we're going to deploy this to larval for to support postgres 15. So we'll call this open agents. Port. I'm assuming the default will work there. Should I automatically start the service on log in? Yeah, let's do that. Default user of postgres SQL is postgres with no password. Thank you. So I'm going to start that. In DB connection, I think that maps to a. Yep, they have a PG SQL connection. So I should be able to just swap that out. The DB port is 5432. And it said the default user is postgres. The DB database name is open agents. And looks like that was created. Let's start it. Downloading binaries. And then if all goes well, looks like that's running. So now, this is a new terminal window. If I do PHP, artisan, migrate, that should run the migrations. It did not. Database open agents does not exist. Oh, I guess it's called postgres. The name of our service is open agents, but the database name is postgres. Let's try it again. Okay, PHP artisan migrate ran our database migrations. Our database migrations live in database migrations. It creates a user's table. Prost-word reset tokens failed the jobs for cues. Personal access tokens. Okay, cool. So we have the database configured. What's the next step? We can learn about that there. Now, once you've created a new layer of application, you may install a layer of LBREES using Composer. I have Composer installed. You might need to install Composer. You can Google how install Composer PHP. Okay, that's done. Let me commit that. After Composer has installed a layer of LBREES package, you may run the Breeze install artisan command. This command publishes the authentication views, routes, controllers, other resources to your application. Layout LBREES publishes all of its codes to your application so that you have full control and visibility over its features and implementation. The Breeze install command will prompt you for your preferred front-end stack and testing framework. So, which stack would you like to install? React with inertia? Would you like any optional features? Yes, I would like dark mode. Enersha SSR. Do we want inertia SSR? I'm going to do no for now. I don't want to run any separate command. I have to think about that. I do want TypeScript. Experimental. Experimental. Experimental. Experimental. Experimental. Experimental. And we're going to use PES for the testing framework, which is a superset of PHP. Look at all those files. Okay. Breeze scaffolding installed successfully. So, I'm going to put PHPRs in Breeze install with dark mode and TypeScript. Okay. Run the migrations unless it already did that. NPM install. And then I like doing NPM run dev in the same panel as here. Okay. So, we now have... We now have automatically added here log in and register. And we have an entire authentication system with a little dashboard where I can go change my profile, update my password, password reset, and all this is kind of handled for us. That feels good. And that's connected to our Postgres database. And if I go to my Postgres database, I'm using TablePlus. And I go to Users, there's the user. Pretty cool for a six-ish minute video. We'll stop there for now. See ya.

[07:34 - 07:37] So we'll call this open agents.
[07:37 - 07:38] Port.
[07:38 - 07:40] I'm assuming the default will work there.
[07:41 - 07:44] Should I automatically start the service on log in? Yeah, let's do that.
[07:44 - 07:47] Default user of postgres SQL is postgres with no password.
[07:47 - 07:48] Thank you.
[07:48 - 07:50] So I'm going to start that.
[07:53 - 07:58] In DB connection, I think that maps to a.
[08:00 - 08:04] Yep, they have a PG SQL connection.
[08:04 - 08:07] So I should be able to just swap that out.
[08:08 - 08:12] The DB port is 5432.
[08:12 - 08:17] And it said the default user is postgres.
[08:21 - 08:26] The DB database name is open agents.
[08:26 - 08:30] And looks like that was created.
[08:30 - 08:32] Let's start it.
[08:32 - 08:35] Downloading binaries.
[08:35 - 08:38] And then if all goes well,
[08:38 - 08:41] looks like that's running.
[08:41 - 08:44] So now, this is a new terminal window.
[08:44 - 08:48] If I do PHP, artisan, migrate,
[08:48 - 08:52] that should run the migrations.
[08:52 - 08:55] It did not.
[08:55 - 08:59] Database open agents does not exist.
[08:59 - 09:04] Oh, I guess it's called postgres.
[09:05 - 09:07] The name of our service is open agents,
[09:07 - 09:09] but the database name is postgres.
[09:09 - 09:11] Let's try it again.
[09:11 - 09:15] Okay, PHP artisan migrate ran our database migrations.
[09:15 - 09:18] Our database migrations live in database migrations.
[09:18 - 09:21] It creates a user's table.
[09:21 - 09:26] Prost-word reset tokens failed the jobs for cues.
[09:26 - 09:29] Personal access tokens.
[09:29 - 09:32] Okay, cool.
[09:32 - 09:35] So we have the database configured.
[09:35 - 09:38] What's the next step?
[09:38 - 09:43] We can learn about that there.
[09:43 - 09:46] Now, once you've created a new layer of application,
[09:46 - 09:50] you may install a layer of LBREES using Composer.
[09:52 - 09:54] I have Composer installed.
[09:54 - 09:56] You might need to install Composer.
[09:56 - 09:59] You can Google how install Composer PHP.
[10:00 - 10:02] Okay, that's done.
[10:02 - 10:05] Let me commit that.
[10:05 - 10:08] After Composer has installed a layer of LBREES package,
[10:08 - 10:10] you may run the Breeze install artisan command.
[10:10 - 10:12] This command publishes the authentication views,
[10:12 - 10:15] routes, controllers, other resources to your application.
[10:15 - 10:18] Layout LBREES publishes all of its codes to your application
[10:18 - 10:20] so that you have full control and visibility
[10:20 - 10:23] over its features and implementation.
[10:23 - 10:25] The Breeze install command will prompt you
[10:25 - 10:28] for your preferred front-end stack and testing framework.
[10:28 - 10:33] So, which stack would you like to install?
[10:33 - 10:36] React with inertia?
[10:36 - 10:39] Would you like any optional features?
[10:39 - 10:43] Yes, I would like dark mode.
[10:43 - 10:46] Enersha SSR.
[10:52 - 10:55] Do we want inertia SSR?
[10:58 - 11:01] I'm going to do no for now.
[11:01 - 11:04] I don't want to run any separate command.
[11:04 - 11:07] I have to think about that.
[11:07 - 11:10] I do want TypeScript.
[11:10 - 11:13] Experimental.
[11:13 - 11:16] Experimental.
[11:16 - 11:19] Experimental.
[11:19 - 11:22] Experimental.
[11:22 - 11:25] Experimental.
[11:25 - 11:27] Experimental.
[11:28 - 11:32] And we're going to use PES for the testing framework,
[11:32 - 11:34] which is a superset of PHP.
[11:40 - 11:44] Look at all those files.
[11:58 - 12:02] Okay.
[12:02 - 12:08] Breeze scaffolding installed successfully.
[12:08 - 12:11] So, I'm going to put PHPRs in Breeze install
[12:11 - 12:16] with dark mode and TypeScript.
[12:16 - 12:18] Okay.
[12:18 - 12:26] Run the migrations unless it already did that.
[12:26 - 12:30] NPM install.
[12:30 - 12:37] And then I like doing NPM run dev in the same panel as here.
[12:37 - 12:40] Okay.
[12:40 - 12:46] So, we now have...
[12:46 - 12:53] We now have automatically added here log in and register.
[12:53 - 13:02] And we have an entire authentication system with a little dashboard
[13:02 - 13:06] where I can go change my profile, update my password, password reset,
[13:06 - 13:12] and all this is kind of handled for us.
[13:12 - 13:16] That feels good.
[13:16 - 13:19] And that's connected to our Postgres database.
[13:19 - 13:24] And if I go to my Postgres database, I'm using TablePlus.
[13:24 - 13:27] And I go to Users, there's the user.
[13:27 - 13:31] Pretty cool for a six-ish minute video.
[13:31 - 13:33] We'll stop there for now.
[13:33 - 13:34] See ya.
