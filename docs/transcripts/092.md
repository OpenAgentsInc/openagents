## Full Transcript

Don't you love videos full of demos that you can't actually use? This is not one of those. You can try this all right now at OpenAgence.com. And you love my dramatic readings, right? So let's do it for the blog post. Introducing the agent store. Today we launched the open beta of the agent store, the world's first AI agent marketplace with revenue sharing paid daily in Bitcoin. Now anyone in the world can create AI agents and earn a share of their revenue. The agent store is live now at OpenAgence.com and we invite you to try it. You can explore agents at the store, build your own agent and read the docs. I like starting with the docs. Let's just see kind of what this is all about. We got some new beautiful docs. Thank you, Mitt LaFai for the best docs product for sure. All right, AI chat and build agents, the basics up there and advance stuff like the plug-ins, Python SDK, architecture overview, if you like the nerd stuff. Look at that. Basics of AI chat. So we've had a chat product live for a month or so with people happily paying for any of the top 18 models with one subscription price. That's been nice. And you can now do kind of that same thing, but with custom agents created by users. And build agents. Let's try to build an agent. Let's see it work in the store. Bobo. Bobo, tell me about Bobo. Make stuff up. All right, I'm not going to attach knowledge right now or maybe I will. Let's add this suite agent. Make stuff up. Include info from this suite agent paper, but be funny and Bobo and type in lower case. This is the instructions of the agent. Okay, Bobo says funny stuff sometimes about suite agent. Okay, so agent is the publicly accessible description. This is the instructions to the agent. And let's give that a try. It might take a few minutes for the PDF to finish processing. Let's just see if we've got basic functionality working. Who are you? I'm Bobo, your friendly AI assistant. I'm here to help you with all your questions and concerns. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Okay, now can we see Bobo on the store? Let's check out the store. So this is modeled off of the open AI GPT store. Very basic kind of list of featured agents at the top, agent concierge. Here's a basic rag agent with a PDF about OpenGL. And then trending. So these numbers here, the chat icon is how many individual chats it's had. The user icon shows how many individual users have chatted with it. And those two things are what determine trending, as well as there's how many Bitcoin sat's Satoshi, the smallest denominational Bitcoin, have been earned by that agents. Oh, I want to try rubber ducky. Let's see. DuckyListens understands and helps you find the answers to your coding questions and maybe even more. Who are you? That's usually my preferred initial go to question. This is right now going to this complex backend. You can read about the architecture thing with rag and stuff like that. Some of it's a little bit slow, but that'll get faster over time. OK. What do you know any programming languages? Although I probably shouldn't be asking a rubber ducky about programming languages. But maybe there's like a really good, OK, thank you rubber ducky. Let's go back to the store. I want to find Bobo. And then I want to promote Bobo because I want to get paid for Bobo. As you can see, these are all just like little demo agents that are developers have made. Where is Bobo? Nick's OS, that looks like someone created like a nice agent, although they put too much of the instructions in the description. That's OK. Where the heck is Bobo? Let me search for Bobo. Oh, there's Bobo. Bobo says funny stuff sometimes about sweet agent. Do you know about sweet agents? That's like some AI paper with some benchmark. I've been using that to kind of demos with it. Yeah, I know about sweet agent. Bobo knows all about them. Sweet agents are like super powered software engineers. They're the ones who get to work on the coolest project. Bobo, sweet agent. So I can't even tell if this is using the actual PDF. Anyways, it doesn't matter because I'm going to get paid for this usage. So let's go learn about the payouts. In build agents, we got a section here for payouts. While the agent store is in beta, payouts will be made once daily with amounts of Bitcoin proportional to usage. Payment rates will vary. Generally, top agents should earn at least a few dollars worth of Bitcoin per day. To earn Bitcoin, you must attach a lightning address to your account in settings. You can read about the lightning address at that link, like an email address, but for your Bitcoin, note, this is not an email address. Do not put your email address in the box for lightning agent. You will not be paid. Yeah, that's what it looks like in the settings, which you can access by clicking up top right, go into settings, and you'll see lightning address right there. If that's there, then you will get paid. If you do not yet have a lightning address, the easiest way to obtain one is by signing up on Stackernoos. In a few weeks, Stackernoos, by the way, is like a Reddit kind of hacker news situation integrating with Bitcoin Lightning. And if you create an account, which is as easy as signing up with Twitter, Nostra, the same way that you sign up for open agents, they give you a lightning address. And then you'll get paid and see your balance there. Okay. In a few weeks, we will soon introduce pay as you go pricing for some agents. Users will have agent credit balances that will pay for advanced agents. We are moving in a direction of fully programmatic payouts tied to paid usage. See our flow of funds, WikiPage, for more on that. This will come to a point where people are paying for agent usage and the agent credit is split between all the different people contributing to the agent to workflow. There's some examples going to their lightning wallets. It'll take us a number of months to kind of get this vision fully implemented, but we're moving in that direction. Agent builders without lightning addresses attached to their accounts will instead be paid in agent credits. If you need help with anything related to Bitcoin or if any questions about payouts, create a post in our Stackernoos community. This is an area that we have just for our community called Open Agents in there. And you can also access that from the sidebar. Okay. We have a lot more that we want to do, but I just want to take a quick little victory lap here because we set out 90 videos ago, six months ago, in response to the OpenAI Dev Day in November of 2023, when OpenAI announced this idea for a GPT store and they were going to let developers get paid theoretically for a little GPT agent, things that they made. From what we can tell, zero people have been paid six months later. Our prediction was correct that they're going to half-ass the monetization, but that here was where there should be a network that pays people instantly, fractionally, fractionally permissionlessly using this global payments network called Bitcoin and specifically the lighting network for fast payments, small payments, Bitcoin. We said, hey, let's build a 100% open source, open models and data open compute, open money, open agent marketplace with revshare. And we built that over six months. And we now have at least the milestone called, we have shipped essentially the same stuff that OpenAI shipped their GPT store with, except we actually have payments. And in addition to that, we kind of took some extra time to build a lot of this kind of solving certain problems at the protocol level. And we're going to have increasing kind of blog posts and explainers going into this kind of thing. But the agents themselves are kind of upgradable via plugins. We've got some plugins, bounties you can read about on our docs. So we're going to be kind of collectively upgrading agents and paying people like you to use or build them. So thanks so much for following along. If you're new, please go to openagents.com, make an account and try it out and let us know how you like it and how we can make it more useful for you. See you soon.

[8:41 - 8:45] We've got some plugins, bounties you can read about on our docs.

[9:03 - 9:06] how you like it and how we can make it more useful for you.

[9:07 - 9:07] See you soon.
