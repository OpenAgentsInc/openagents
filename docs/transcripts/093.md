## Full Transcript

We just made a payout of 100,000 sats across four agent builders and I want to show you what we're doing and why and how we're doing it. So we're doing payouts once daily now, this sort of semi-manual process. I needed just kind of like look at the database and make sure people don't game it like some people may have it instead of two because we're distributing Bitcoin. You can read the algorithm that we're using right there. I'd kind of build this over the last hour. So in conversation with open agents starting with right as equal query that finds all users who've created agents and who have an attached lightning address. Grip tile has our code based index, which gave me something to work with. Then I just kind of like swap between different models and used clad opus. Lama got cut off. GPT 40 had to do a bunch of back and forth because some stuff was not clear. But we eventually got it working and did a disbursement. And let's see what else do I want to show you? Yeah, so we wanted to get everyone who made an agent at least 10,000 sats. People who had agents that have been more used, got more sats, score. And yeah, we've paid Bitcoin to people. We're still kind of working to get some of the rag stuff smoothed out as a couple bugs with it. Once that's solid, we're going to be adding referral codes tied to your agents. You'll have a nice share page for your agent and you share that around. And anyone who signs up, you'll get sats for that too. So yeah, we're going to make it rain more and more, but tied to actual usage of agents to help get a whole nice little marketplace of creators here, figuring out what people are actually willing to pay for. Okay, we'll get a nice like sexy dashboard up, explore a situation on our website over the next day or two. And if you have not already gone to open agents.com, please make an agent and chat with it and go into settings and attach your lightning address. So we can pay you back on. See ya.
