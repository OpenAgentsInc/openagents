## Full Transcript

Alright, let's take a look at our roadmap. First, a quick recap. So in April, we launched our chat MVP that's working fine. Chat with 18ish models, one subscription. Cool. We just launched our agent store, basic functionalities working fine there. Featured agents at the top, how many chats, how many people use it, trending. Very basic, but it works. You can upload PDFs and we'll improve the rag and stuff over time. But core functionality works. We've been kind of paying manually every day. Agent payouts, we're going to start switching this into auto. But yeah, look at this. We've paid infinity percent more developers than OpenAI has. You can't even compare our payouts to OpenAI's because it's error divided by zero on their end. Because they're so busy paying lawyers and plaintiffs and we're going to keep paying developers. And they're not going to catch up with us. That feels nice. Okay, so the roadmap. So by the end of this month, kind of rolling out mostly next week, we're going to be switching the kind of manual payouts into more programmatic payouts tied to usage. We're going to be starting to phase out the like bounties that we've been paying for plugins because we just now have a lot of them. And encouraging people to make money through uploading agents and soon plugins all via our UI. But we want there to be like a lot of transparency around, hey, you got paid because this person sent a chat message to your agent and to get you little notification. Some of that stuff we're going to be building and I'm going to kind of get back into our routine of building features on the video stream here. So all stream a bunch of this building and you'll see us build and launch that into this month. Aside from like having that core sort of economic engine in place of people paying for stuff and then the payouts going out to the builders. We want to allow more kind of social discovery to surface what's good and what sucks. So we're going to be building some basic social features around here. Like letting people see profiles and let you like follow your favorite agent builders and being able to comment you can comment on agents like hey this one who loosened it this one sucks. Yeah, that'll help with discovery. Our so all that kind of stuff I'll be building and so we'll do that on stream and then the rest of our developers are focused on the agents plugins UI. So all these like 15-ish plugins that developers have made we've got a big list of those. I think there's some stuff live now where like some agents can have tools enabled where I'll like try to pick the best plugin. So we're building a lot of that stuff kind of in the background last week and next week. But in June we're going to be rolling out more of the UI so you can kind of click and associate what plugins you want with your agents. And then you know any plugins that you use some share of the revenue will go to those plugin builders. And so that's what's going to we think have a lot more useful agents happen because instead of just the basic like prompt engineering and rag. We've got the community providing plugins to enable agents to be upgraded. So kind of slotting that into the marketplace with the same rev share as the agent builders. Quarter three going to be just envision all of that except having drag and drop nodes and that's probably when we're going to be leaning more into the third party integrations. You can envision you know the kind of things that Zapier does where you can like kind of drag and drop different workflows doing that except with community provided plugins and agents. Yeah just kind of building out our multi-sided marketplace and then by quarter four or so we should have conquered the world. Don't you think I think this is a reasonable roadmap. Okay any comments, questions, throw them in our tweet here or you know pop over to our community on stacker.news which is going quite well. And yeah we're chatting about stuff. See you soon.
