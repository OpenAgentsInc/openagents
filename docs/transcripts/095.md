## Full Transcript

Next on our roadmap is pay as you go revenue sharing basically streaming money between users of agents and builders of agents Eventually from agent to agent. I first heard the term streaming money years ago in a talk from early Bitcoin educator Andreas Antonapus The full video is worth watching. That's linked below, but here's 60 seconds of the highlights Streaming video change the nature of video streaming music change the nature of music What happens when we start streaming money? So now think about this for a second if I can do Payments that are on a milliseconds frequency and that are as low as a Satoshi Why not get your salary paid every minute? When you do micro payments over milliseconds the term cash flow takes on a whole different meaning Cash is a flow. It's a continuous stream that has no meaning as an amount When I say streaming money It's gonna take 15 years for us to really understand what that does what that does to Human payments what that does to corporate payments what that does to border payments what that does to the nation state I don't know what that will be yet, but I do know one thing It's gonna be big So that's what we are going to focus on in the next few videos of this video series We want to pay Bitcoin to as many people as possible as much as possible as fast as possible with the easiest User experience we want open agents to pay you the most the fastest the best and the hardest money out there Which is Bitcoin? So maybe you have a job that pays you every two weeks Maybe you qualify for X creator payouts, which pays I was trying to figure it out Yeah pays you every eventually Kind of that's my summary of it every month after 60 days if you meet some criteria. I don't even meet the criteria I don't have five million impressions on your post and then Subscriptions should we do subscriptions we could do subscriptions with open agents? It doesn't think that I'm at least 18 years old. I'm I'm twice 18 years old friend. Okay, whatever So X yeah, you know, we can improve on that dramatically we can improve on open AI's implementation by infinity percent because they're not paying you But we'll pay you every minute and maybe soon it may be faster than that, but I'll be happy if we can just get you paid every every minute That'd be cool. All right, so here's how this works Here's how you get paid you sign up That's easy You log in with Twitter or X or no sir. You do something valuable and That could be creating an agent that someone uses you can write an agent plug in or soon you can do other things like review an agent Refer an agent right opposed Valuable what do we mean by valuable? We mean someone finds value in what you're doing that they're willing to pay for That's it. That's the measuring stick if someone pays for it whether they are using your agent and paying via agent credits for that Whether you're referring an agent and then that person pays for an agent via credits or you're writing a post that like someone tips We'll have a tipping function soon here Someone has paid for it and then you get paid and you'll get all some or most of that depending on For things like agents probably there'll be multiple people who will get paid like anybody who writes a plug-in that gets used We're gonna take a cut but you know Anything that you do that's valuable when there's payments you get paid and then we're gonna build little dashboards for Visualizing all of this and what this allows for is really fast feedback loops If you put up an agent that nobody cares about You know that you haven't to build something useful or you haven't put it in front of the right people and you just it needs more work Market forces hooray so we think this is gonna start a flywheel That's gonna start really speeding up particularly once we have agents that do really cool things the idea here is that we want to Build the best agents and then sell them So we think that this will get increasingly fast once we get our plugins UI We're gonna be launching that probably the first week of June or so. So we've got about 15 of these plugins That people have created and we awarded some bounties those bindings are ending today Just because we've got enough The initial bounties submitted But the plugins from now on are gonna be paid via revshare So the builder of an agent Like the other you guys gonna get some payments any plugins that are used that kind of upgrade it with advanced functionality doing things like You know bitcoins stats you want your agent to be able to pull in information about the mempool or the fees or the nodes or blah blah blah blah You can click that and now your agent has access to that So we've got a lot of that kind of functionality bill. We just got to kind of hook it up to the the agent via the UI So we'll be building that early June but first we want to get this get this little The the funding flywheel and I'm moving this also this is kind of like the bigger picture of What we're doing and example payments like a split a bunch of different ways Okay, so the next few videos we're going to show off the payments the payouts How we're making all this information publicly transparent and inspectable the accounting dashboards and Agent credit all that stuff are gonna be building this week and Then next week we'll start leaning more into the plugins UI. Okay, see you soon

[0:00 - 0:07] Next on our roadmap is pay as you go revenue sharing basically streaming money between users of agents and builders of agents

[0:08 - 0:16] Eventually from agent to agent. I first heard the term streaming money years ago in a talk from early Bitcoin educator Andreas Antonapus

[0:16 - 0:21] The full video is worth watching. That's linked below, but here's 60 seconds of the highlights

[0:21 - 0:26] Streaming video change the nature of video streaming music change the nature of music

[0:26 - 0:29] What happens when we start streaming money?

[0:29 - 0:33] So now think about this for a second if I can do

[0:33 - 0:37] Payments that are on a milliseconds

[0:39 - 0:42] frequency and that are as low as a Satoshi

[0:43 - 0:46] Why not get your salary paid every minute?

[0:47 - 0:55] When you do micro payments over milliseconds the term cash flow takes on a whole different meaning

[0:55 - 1:01] Cash is a flow. It's a continuous stream that has no meaning as an amount

[1:01 - 1:03] When I say streaming money

[1:03 - 1:10] It's gonna take 15 years for us to really understand what that does what that does to

[1:10 - 1:17] Human payments what that does to corporate payments what that does to border payments what that does to the nation state

[1:17 - 1:21] I don't know what that will be yet, but I do know one thing

[1:21 - 1:23] It's gonna be big

[1:25 - 1:29] So that's what we are going to focus on in the next few videos of this video series

[1:29 - 1:36] We want to pay Bitcoin to as many people as possible as much as possible as fast as possible with the easiest

[1:36 - 1:41] User experience we want open agents to pay you the most the fastest the best and the hardest money out there

[1:41 - 1:42] Which is Bitcoin?

[1:42 - 1:46] So maybe you have a job that pays you every two weeks

[1:46 - 1:52] Maybe you qualify for X creator payouts, which pays I was trying to figure it out

[1:53 - 1:56] Yeah pays you every eventually

[1:59 - 2:05] Kind of that's my summary of it every month after 60 days if you meet some criteria. I don't even meet the criteria

[2:05 - 2:09] I don't have five million impressions on your post and then

[2:10 - 2:13] Subscriptions should we do subscriptions we could do subscriptions with open agents?

[2:15 - 2:20] It doesn't think that I'm at least 18 years old. I'm I'm twice 18 years old friend. Okay, whatever

[2:21 - 2:31] So X yeah, you know, we can improve on that dramatically we can improve on open AI's implementation by infinity percent because they're not paying you

[2:32 - 2:39] But we'll pay you every minute and maybe soon it may be faster than that, but I'll be happy if we can just get you paid every every minute

[2:39 - 2:41] That'd be cool. All right, so here's how this works

[2:43 - 2:44] Here's how you get paid you

[2:44 - 2:45] sign up

[2:46 - 2:47] That's easy

[2:48 - 2:52] You log in with Twitter or X or no sir. You do something valuable and

[2:54 - 3:01] That could be creating an agent that someone uses you can write an agent plug in or soon you can do other things like review an agent

[3:02 - 3:04] Refer an agent right opposed

[3:07 - 3:16] Valuable what do we mean by valuable? We mean someone finds value in what you're doing that they're willing to pay for

[3:17 - 3:26] That's it. That's the measuring stick if someone pays for it whether they are using your agent and paying via agent credits for that

[3:28 - 3:37] Whether you're referring an agent and then that person pays for an agent via credits or you're writing a post that like someone tips

[3:37 - 3:40] We'll have a tipping function soon here

[3:42 - 3:48] Someone has paid for it and then you get paid and you'll get all some or most of that depending on

[3:49 - 3:55] For things like agents probably there'll be multiple people who will get paid like anybody who writes a plug-in that gets used

[3:55 - 3:57] We're gonna take a cut but you know

[3:58 - 4:03] Anything that you do that's valuable when there's payments you get paid and then we're gonna build little dashboards for

[4:04 - 4:08] Visualizing all of this and what this allows for is really fast feedback loops

[4:08 - 4:10] If you put up an agent that nobody cares about

[4:11 - 4:17] You know that you haven't to build something useful or you haven't put it in front of the right people and you just it needs more work

[4:18 - 4:21] Market forces hooray so we think this is gonna start a flywheel

[4:21 - 4:28] That's gonna start really speeding up particularly once we have agents that do really cool things the idea here is that we want to

[4:29 - 4:33] Build the best agents and then sell them

[4:34 - 4:39] So we think that this will get increasingly fast once we get our plugins UI

[4:40 - 4:46] We're gonna be launching that probably the first week of June or so. So we've got about 15 of these plugins

[4:47 - 4:52] That people have created and we awarded some bounties those bindings are ending today

[4:54 - 4:55] Just because we've got enough

[4:58 - 5:00] The initial bounties submitted

[5:02 - 5:06] But the plugins from now on are gonna be paid via revshare

[5:07 - 5:09] So the builder of an agent

[5:10 - 5:16] Like the other you guys gonna get some payments any plugins that are used that kind of upgrade it with advanced functionality doing things like

[5:16 - 5:24] You know bitcoins stats you want your agent to be able to pull in information about the mempool or the fees or the nodes or blah blah blah blah

[5:25 - 5:28] You can click that and now your agent has access to that

[5:29 - 5:33] So we've got a lot of that kind of functionality bill. We just got to kind of hook it up to the the

[5:36 - 5:37] agent via the UI

[5:38 - 5:42] So we'll be building that early June but first we want to get this get this little

[5:44 - 5:49] The the funding flywheel and I'm moving this also this is kind of like the

[5:50 - 5:51] bigger picture of

[5:52 - 5:55] What we're doing and example payments like a split a bunch of different ways

[5:59 - 6:01] Okay, so the next few videos we're going to

[6:02 - 6:04] show off the

[6:05 - 6:07] payments the payouts

[6:08 - 6:12] How we're making all this information publicly transparent and inspectable the accounting dashboards and

[6:14 - 6:17] Agent credit all that stuff are gonna be building this week and

[6:18 - 6:23] Then next week we'll start leaning more into the plugins UI. Okay, see you soon
