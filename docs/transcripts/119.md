## Full Transcript

Hey, we're live openagents.com. Let's do it. So you can log in with GitHub Twitter or email. If you're going to be doing GitHub stuff, you should log in with GitHub. But if you don't, you can do manage account up here and then just connect it later. We're using Clark for auth, which is super cool. Okay, so we got pains, HUD pains. All of them are dragable, resizable. So you can configure your chat workspace how you want. If you command, click or whatever the windows equivalent is, you can open multiple pains here. Multiple chats at one time. Pretty cool. Okay, oh, that'll get increasingly cool as we add different types of pains like multiplayer and stuff, data visualization, et cetera. So models, tools, GitHub, down here, you will start off with free unlimited-ish access to DPT40 mini. So you can try that out and once you get it working, you can buy some credits, which I'm currently going to give myself some credits here to use the advanced models. For the next few days, if you DM openagents, ink, we will give you $10 of credits to play around with. Okay, so I'm going to use Sonnet and that is the right repo. And then these are my usual four tools for my day-to-day workflow. All connected to the GitHub repo, being able to create and rewrite files directly to a GitHub branch and then view file view hierarchy. Okay, so I'm showing you what I do. So you can kind of see how this works. I'll give it a little briefing. And you can just chat with it as normal. I'm going to give it some kind of starting paths to look at first and it can traverse any of those and add those files to the context. If you're using one of the GPT40 class models, it'll be able to do these kinds of tool calls in parallel. That's pretty nice. A quad just kind of steps through methodically. So one thing to be aware of is that all of these files right now, it's adding the entire context to the chat, which can be good, but also it can get expensive. And as you can see, my credits are deducting up here. So you will have to be mindful of your credits. And then if you'll free to switch over to GPT40 many. You'll also want to have conversations be relatively short because, along great as the more of the context that gets passed in. Okay, so it went through, went ahead and rewrote a file. Eventually, we'll do more kind of like pull request approval manual approval things. This is kind of errors on the side of getting stuff done quickly. So we got to pull in the better diff viewer. But you can see here, toggling between the older and the new, that's the older content. We removed the hardcoded repo. And it's nice also that the new content bumped up the storage key. I didn't ask you to do that clear out the old version. So we're basically making it so that this GitHub button down here doesn't just show hardcoded data or doesn't show for everybody. It only shows for people who have connected to get that account. And if you don't have an account connected, it'll prompt you with like a modal to connect and what the instructions are. Okay, and it edited input settings. This definitely took longer. It takes time proportional to the length of the file because it's doing whole file edits. And then over time, we'll get that more optimized to use more surgical edits. So that just been a forcing function for me to like write smaller files that fit better into Condex window. Okay, let's see what it did. These changes implement the requested features. We've removed the hardcoded demo open agent's repo from the store. We've updated the inputs settings component to use the use user hook from clerk instead of use off. I don't know if that will end up having been correct, but we'll see. At a state variable is GitHub connected. Okay. Baba, blah. Use an async function to use a find hook that's good. And yeah, sometimes it'll like get confused about client server components. As well as like things like the clerk docs. I don't think is fully represented in the training set. So sometimes you got to kind of manually paste some stuff. That's why I add some additional context there. But now let's take a look at it. The goal is eventually for you to not have to go over to the GitHub repo interface at all. But so it made two commits. And it first removed those lines in repo store. That looks great. And then I've had to record this video a previous time because this would blow up the app if it did something wrong and tried to use the server based logic in a client component. But looks like this is pretty good putting the server action thing in a use effect. I don't know if this user syntax is correct. Even though I copypasted from the clerk website, their React docs are not the same as their next JS. Okay, let's try a moment of truth. Get pull. I have to worry about this blowing up the app if it fails. You don't because you won't be working on this app. It looks like it worked. At least it works like it didn't blow things up. So what happened exactly? Well, we need to test this out if we are logged out. So why don't we maybe try logging with a different thing? Let me switch over to this account that I know does not have a account. All right, let's log in with Twitter. That's weird. This might still have it connected. Let me do this. Can I disconnect this? Okay, let me try this again. Log in with Twitter now that I don't have the get of account connected. Okay, look, we got a button. What do you think happens when I hit the button? Exactly what I wanted to do to use the rebus selector. You need to connect your get of account. Click your profile top leg. Bubble block. That is what I wanted. Okay, let's do it. Manage account. Connect. GitHub. This email address. Okay, it's had that previously. But it did it anyways. All right, let's test it out, I guess. Let's test it out with mini. And I'm going to say, go to main branch. This is a private repo so it won't work if it doesn't have access. Read everything in the docs and knowledge folders. And summarize and advise on next steps. Please work. Be really cool if it's worked. They able to be okay. So I'm guessing, let me try refreshing the page. Let's try it again. Read everything in docs, knowledge, and summarize here. Hmm. Okay, well, I think that's just because there's a conflict there. I don't have another get up account that I can test this with. Okay, well, guess what? I'm going to test this offline and if you're watching this video with this in it, it means it's succeeded. Please go try this out at openagents.com. Try it out for free with this. DM Openagents Inc. on Twitter will give you $10 of credits to try out the advanced models. Find a workflow that works for you. Once you get good and this is like you're getting value from this, feel free to add some credits there to keep using it. And please give us feedback, tell us what works, what doesn't. We're going to be making edits to this very rapidly multiple times per week, particularly because we can use it to build itself. Please let us know how to make this more awesome for you. And we'll see you soon.

[5:30 - 5:31] So what happened exactly?

[5:37 - 5:40] Well, we need to test this out if we are logged out.

[5:40 - 5:41] So why don't we maybe

[5:42 - 5:46] try logging with a different thing?

[5:46 - 5:50] Let me switch over to this account that I know does not have a account.

[5:50 - 5:51] All right, let's log in with Twitter.

[5:54 - 5:55] That's weird.

[5:58 - 6:00] This might still have it connected.

[6:00 - 6:04] Let me do this.

[6:04 - 6:05] Can I disconnect this?

[6:12 - 6:14] Okay, let me try this again.

[6:14 - 6:17] Log in with Twitter now that I don't have the get of account connected.

[6:21 - 6:22] Okay, look, we got a button.

[6:23 - 6:24] What do you think happens when I hit the button?

[6:27 - 6:29] Exactly what I wanted to do to use the rebus selector.

[6:30 - 6:31] You need to connect your get of account.

[6:32 - 6:33] Click your profile top leg.

[6:33 - 6:34] Bubble block.

[6:34 - 6:35] That is what I wanted.

[6:36 - 6:37] Okay, let's do it.

[6:37 - 6:38] Manage account.

[6:39 - 6:40] Connect.

[6:40 - 6:41] GitHub.

[6:44 - 6:45] This email address.

[6:45 - 6:47] Okay, it's had that previously.

[6:48 - 6:50] But it did it anyways.

[6:51 - 6:52] All right, let's test it out, I guess.

[6:53 - 6:54] Let's test it out with mini.

[6:55 - 6:57] And I'm going to say, go to main branch.

[6:58 - 7:00] This is a private repo so it won't work if it doesn't have access.

[7:03 - 7:06] Read everything in the docs and knowledge folders.

[7:06 - 7:10] And summarize and advise on next steps.

[7:11 - 7:12] Please work.

[7:13 - 7:14] Be really cool if it's worked.

[7:17 - 7:19] They able to be okay.

[7:19 - 7:21] So I'm guessing, let me try refreshing the page.

[7:26 - 7:27] Let's try it again.

[7:27 - 7:32] Read everything in docs, knowledge, and summarize here.

[7:38 - 7:39] Hmm.

[7:54 - 7:55] Okay, well, guess what?

[7:56 - 8:00] I'm going to test this offline and if you're watching this video with this in it,

[8:00 - 8:00] it means it's succeeded.

[8:02 - 8:05] Please go try this out at openagents.com.

[8:07 - 8:08] Try it out for free with this.

[8:09 - 8:13] DM Openagents Inc. on Twitter will give you $10 of credits to try out the advanced models.

[8:14 - 8:16] Find a workflow that works for you.

[8:16 - 8:19] Once you get good and this is like you're getting value from this, feel free to add some credits there

[8:20 - 8:21] to keep using it.
