Hard to believe we're celebrating one year of this series year one first of many we're at 137 episodes and You know you might think that's a lot, but we're trying to catch up to handmade hero here this Project from Casey, you know, they got they got they got they got six hundred sixty seven episodes So we're just we're just getting started here at open agents But I wanted to review what we did for the last year for those just tuning in or curious what we've been up to and Let's start by asking open agents what we've been up to so scrape the video series link and summarize the topics here in two paragraphs This is our pro interface. We're gonna start opening us up to the public quite soon, but yeah Our video series so far is documented the development of an open source AI agents platform Spending 137 episodes from initial set up to advanced features the early episodes cover foundational work including text docs election Laravel implementation and basic agent principles the series then progresses through key developments like PDF chat capabilities Rageualmentation and the creation of later called auto dev a GitHub integrated coding agent later episodes showcase more advanced features including plugin systems Lightning network integration for payments agent node graphs and various UI improvements recent episodes focus on auto dev capabilities Code based index indexing and the development of open press the series demonstrates an evolution from basic agent functionality to a sophisticated Platform incorporating AI coding assistance Payments systems and developer tools with a strong emphasis on open source. Okay, so that's all more or less accurate I would say one kind of problem or With the you know problem with that rosy explanation there is that all of that is kind of split across a few different code bases Our agent store that we launched Four or five months ago ish is in the V1 code base that is not no longer actively maintained will go into Some of the lessons learned from that shortly the version to interface sort of our developer focused auto dev interface for Interacting with GitHub code bases that still live at stage two dot open agents dot com I've been using this every day for the last number of months until this past week starting to move that over To our version three pro interface, which we're gonna start rolling out more publicly This has supports for teams more tools more repos Latest models and we're gonna start pulling back in some of the Agent store and incentivized plug-ins stuff from our version one interface So let's step through a few of the lessons that we learned so I'm gonna say lesson number one is kind of revenue matters most It's kind of related to two and three here, which is Before we get to creative on Protocol things like our version one interface. We did a whole bunch of creative stuff around Noster and we kind of think got a little bit ahead of ourselves because what we ended up running into was actually a similar Problem to what we ran into with GPU topia before this, which is we had a bunch of supply lined up like when we did our GPU topia Our sort of decentralized GPU compute network using lightning We had a whole bunch of sellers on a whole bunch of compute sellers happily come by and want to sell compute contributing it to our open AI compatible API endpoint that supported inference fine tuning embedding and image generation the problem there was that we just didn't have any real Bison demand lined up It was difficult at that time to be competing against sort of the sort of like VC subsidized race to the bottom in terms of infrastructure Prices back when we were like specifically trying to pitch this API and we ran into like pretty much the same problem with the version one of our agent store Which is it was great that we had the ability Technically to have people be able to contribute Agent plugins to this marketplace and have you know some usage on the front end and have the lightning paid out Go to the people that were building the plugin the problem was that we were kind of pitching that at this sort of like consumer audience Where it wasn't really clear what they would want to use it for we'd kind of hope that sort of Like market forces would figure it out and market forces did not really figure it out And maybe that was just mismanagement on our part or not doing or saying the right things But the kind of like lesson that we learned from there is like okay We really need to start by focusing on what is the first use case for which people are actually willing to put down a credit card or You know chunk a Bitcoin and pay for real usage of something Our first kind of calculation that that would be coding agents So we built our version to coding agent just just to be like a really good workflow for Interacting with GitHub code base and being able to have you know an agent loop through and do meaningful things Over like a 90 second time window where People are able to be more productive as a developer here and that was okay. We had a few You know developers using this happily. I have been using it happily and heavily But the the real success in generating revenue came only recently when we started shifting to business customers People that have been either either having challenges hiring or they've got basically pain points that are not in the tens of dollars per month or the hundreds of dollars per month by their in the thousands of dollars per month So we've been using our sort of um agents Agent interface to auto-debt interface in this new pro interface sort of in this applied format directly to a few customers Call it a private beta or whatever um And that has addressed the thing that we had not had until this point which is what is the use case that people are willing to pay money for Now that we have that now that we have an idea of like what is the profile of the person the company that wants to pay Thousands of dollars a month for some sort of compound AI system that solves problems for them Now we can reason about okay, how do we extend that into things like you know Some of our customers want more than just the current integrations that we offer they might want something that goes to their Slack or just other types of things that you can imagine that this would be absolutely perfect for the whole agent plug-in idea that we like previously Speckdown built now to combine that in So anyway, we're we'll get to that in terms of like what we're doing next One of the other lessons was that the simplicity of the tech stack does not equal simplicity of development I have said even recently that I've gotten tired of certain of the like you know the big JavaScript and I've been really kind of taken by the the sort of swan song of You know siren song of of htmx and doing things simply and getting away from like big JavaScript and stuff And you know, you know, it was started with v1 with lara val Did v2 with versel and xjs and react v3 you know tried a bunch of different ways to use go or htmx or lara val without a bunch of like crazy JavaScript And I just came to the realization that It's really really really difficult to um be more productive Then what the you know vc batch companies are Spending a lot of time energy and resources to put into your hands in terms of specifically AI tooling The uh versel for example the versel a isdk Uh that powers this sort of chat and tool use of our version two and now version three interfaces um It's it's hard to beat. I've tried to recreate that in multiple different ways. I've got it like Working decently on the front end, but then the back end like there's just they solve a whole lot of stuff is really hard to get away from Um, so it's like all right one lesson is just like stop being cute We can get in the future when we want to do things in a different way and use I don't know other stacks, but like it's really Stop being cute about tech just do what's necessary to get the product out and that kind of gets to like yeah product before protocol or like you know Letting my my inner computer nerd that wants to do like the cutting edge that no one else is doing or like BHTmx to be funnily contrarian like I want to do that I spiritually want to be doing that but like realistically we got a ship product that um works uh if you know there's a new AI integration that comes out and versel adds it the next day instead of needing to build on myself It's just like the practicality of that has won out Uh, it's just like a principle that we need to hold um So some takeaways here are our core thesis is intact. I expressed in the opening video of this series like um We now agree basically with sam ultman this was done like the day after the open AI dev day presentation a year plus ago where um They're all talking about that the future was going to be agents I said you know I absolutely agree with that that This agents are the things that Businesses are going to be paying for people are going to be paying for and to take that one step further I believe that every person every business every family every street corner every device is going to have one or more agents AI agents basically compound AI systems working either on your behalf or as part of the system or as part of the device or part of the physical location agents will be Everywhere do you want these massive closed source corporations with poor incentives with every incentive to get their tendrils around the government Scare-monger about AI safety and try to erect barriers to keep out startups like we cannot let that happen this time It's the stakes are too high to mess with that level of you know interference with what should be an organic bottom-up evolutionary process so This general idea that everyone's gonna have agents and also that open Is going to be better than closed? I feel it's like fully strengthened and validated in that like these is Um which of these is going to win open versus closed? That's still an open question um I think that You know regardless of what you think about the election the fact that open AI's you know regulatory efforts and anthropic relative regulatory efforts Are probably going to be a lot less in impact? Because of what happened with the US election here where like the whole Big tech regulatory AI apparatus is just going to kind of fall on deaf ears um to some extent I mean you know Elon in there. It's just it's going to get interesting But the certainly the momentum is going to be on the side of the the builders and the the truly open Builders I think so our core thesis is intact. We're doing the right thing. We are I mean We're on it. We are we smell blood and we're We're coming after the uh the big fat unicorns Okay, uh other takeaway in Centivized interop matters um What we had when we had a bunch of like you know 20 different developers coming and writing plugins and and having that Process in place. It's like I could see very clearly that this is the future of How we build this sort of like unified Agent substrate that's usable by all people obviously this idea of sort of this operating system for all businesses is Probably larger of a scope than any single one person or company is going to be able to take on but We have certainly position at open agents to provide a leading role in that in part because we have an answer to this question of in center Incentivized interoperability and um I'm going to touch more on this in in the next few videos I think because this is like uh important to what we're going to be doing next as we start to reboot our plugin systems Uh, but this is actually a pretty good um A thread some agent develop investor guy was asking about stuff and um This conversation about people thinking that hey should we have this incentive mechanism for open source development for Participation in value capture as a way to like lubricate interactions between projects that are maybe working on the same thing Um, you know longer term consideration mobile You know the protocols and interrupt angle that this other person's asking about um Let me find this actually. This is probably good. Yeah, so is this not better suited as a protocol standardization issue Should these different agent providers conform to a portable and provider agnostic protocol or standard instead of not doing so like This is stuff that I've been grappling with specifically earlier in the series as it's like okay. We think that we see The broad strokes of how that needs to happen We think that bitcoin obviously pays an important role in for agent payments Nostra for agent communication and doing plugin registries like you know more on that well earlier in the series and soon um And so you know some other founder here's out is saying hey, you know, how can we do this should be allocate equity to OS S contributors and my thing is like well We think that revenue sharing is better than equity Compensating agent builders fairly in real time proportional to the value that they create as measured by and so like we did that piece But as measured by What customers mainly businesses with real budgets are willing to pay for so if we have one platform called open agents That solves the distribution for them because we have one beautiful amazing reputable brand and open agents.com and like companies They're gonna feel comfortable like all right like I'll pay open agents I'll load up some credits and then how does that get spent how it gets spent is answered in part by Us doing a little bit of the infrastructure But the bulk of the sort of like long tail of okay, I want to build an agent that has this integration knows about this data set And you know This configuration of things that some of which may require very niche Level knowledge or integration to have that provided by someone Agent developer plug-in someone who contributes data or whatever who has it now a mechanism to upload that And get rewarded proportional to that we think that that is the future. We build a bunch of infrastructure for that We had not yet connected it to revenue streams and that is what we are now about to do Okay, so anything else that I want to say here No, so you'll see more from us over the next few weeks We're going to be rolling out more in this incentivized interrupt Direction kind of rebooting our old plug-in system and connecting it to our Business dashboard here The work continues. I mean, there's still a lot a lot a lot more to do There's a lot of stuff that we didn't really fully do like Building on fully open models. We're still like kind of heavily dependent on clawed for a bunch of stuff But I think that adds the prompts and our sort of like prompt library and plug-in library get better a lot of that Can work with llama just like to the extent that that is a thing that people want to pay for like having the open marketplace where that Kind of like incentivized collaboration can Happened in one place. So one thing that I want to say also as a belief And I'll actually add this to our takeaways. I do strongly believe like the future of agent builders the future of agents is multiplayer Building all of this and using all of this is going to be best by incentivizing Contributors to work together. So we're not all reinventing the wheel We're not inventing the 15th agent framework It's like how do we start speaking the same language? I think the The how of how that happens is through You know a neutral agnostic data protocol, which we'll call Noster and how you kind of lubricate the incentives of that How do you incentivize the participation as you pay people you pay people what you pay them money What do you not pay them you don't pay them a fucking shit coin some Chuck E cheese coupon token that someone just made up You pay them real money. How do you get real money? You have customers pay you for it Not that everyone needs to pay us in Bitcoin. You can pay us in dollars. We'll pay out and big like we'll figure that part out But we think that the future of agents is multiplayer and that's on the sort of like provision of service side and also on the The usage side so teams. I mean, I think that the teams products of chat GPT and Anthropic are very limited I think there's so much room for expansion particularly into more of the kind of standard productivity of things like Microsoft teams like why should you have people have separate like calendar apps or chat apps or all this bullshit Like don't you want just like one dashboard like I do most of my work these days now in this interface and with this now teams integration Now if I have two different um People have on the same team That can have the same chat window open They can see the same chats coming in that's live right now Um, it's still kind of invite only for people that are like paying us and working with us If you want to get access to this just shoot me a dm. We'll open this up more broadly over the coming weeks but um Yeah, I think the future is multiplayer There's gonna be a lot more that can be done with like letting people see agents working like what is the visibility into what agents are out there working maybe we want to have agents where I have a particular research task that I want to do on something that is of importance to let's just say like You know some public policy issue in the United States I want to have some agents do some research and maybe I formulate the question and I like get the agent all set up And you could see that it's doing good work But it costs money for compute so maybe someone who cares about that issue wants to like donate some Bitcoin to have it keep going And have all this kind of happen more in public. We have we are to this point over the last year Still completely missing the idea of actual collaboration incentivized collaboration in the agent space and I think we're really well positioned to do that Um, stay tuned. Thanks so much. Happy for any feedback questions insults and we'll see you soon

[0:00 - 0:07] Hard to believe we're celebrating one year of this series year one first of many we're at 137 episodes and

[0:08 - 0:12] You know you might think that's a lot, but we're trying to catch up to handmade hero here this

[0:12 - 0:18] Project from Casey, you know, they got they got they got they got six hundred sixty seven episodes

[0:18 - 0:20] So we're just we're just getting started here at open agents

[0:20 - 0:26] But I wanted to review what we did for the last year for those just tuning in or curious what we've been up to and

[0:27 - 0:34] Let's start by asking open agents what we've been up to so scrape the video series link and summarize the topics here in two paragraphs

[0:35 - 0:41] This is our pro interface. We're gonna start opening us up to the public quite soon, but yeah

[0:41 - 0:46] Our video series so far is documented the development of an open source AI agents platform

[0:46 - 0:53] Spending 137 episodes from initial set up to advanced features the early episodes cover foundational work including text docs election

[0:53 - 0:59] Laravel implementation and basic agent principles the series then progresses through key developments like PDF chat capabilities

[1:00 - 1:08] Rageualmentation and the creation of later called auto dev a GitHub integrated coding agent later episodes showcase more advanced features including plugin systems

[1:08 - 1:14] Lightning network integration for payments agent node graphs and various UI improvements recent episodes focus on auto dev capabilities

[1:14 - 1:21] Code based index indexing and the development of open press the series demonstrates an evolution from basic agent functionality to a sophisticated

[1:21 - 1:23] Platform incorporating AI coding assistance

[1:23 - 1:29] Payments systems and developer tools with a strong emphasis on open source. Okay, so that's all more or less accurate

[1:29 - 1:33] I would say one kind of problem or

[1:33 - 1:39] With the you know problem with that rosy explanation there is that all of that is kind of split across a few different code bases

[1:39 - 1:41] Our agent store that we launched

[1:42 - 1:48] Four or five months ago ish is in the V1 code base that is not no longer actively maintained will go into

[1:48 - 1:51] Some of the lessons learned from that shortly

[1:52 - 1:53] the version to

[1:53 - 1:57] interface sort of our developer focused auto dev

[1:57 - 1:58] interface for

[1:59 - 2:03] Interacting with GitHub code bases that still live at stage two dot open agents dot com

[2:03 - 2:09] I've been using this every day for the last number of months until this past week starting to move that over

[2:10 - 2:16] To our version three pro interface, which we're gonna start rolling out more publicly

[2:16 - 2:18] This has supports for teams

[2:19 - 2:21] more tools more repos

[2:22 - 2:25] Latest models and we're gonna start pulling back in some of the

[2:26 - 2:30] Agent store and incentivized plug-ins stuff from our version one interface

[2:31 - 2:33] So let's step through a few of the lessons that we learned

[2:34 - 2:35] so

[2:36 - 2:41] I'm gonna say lesson number one is kind of revenue matters most

[2:41 - 2:44] It's kind of related to two and three here, which is

[2:44 - 2:47] Before we get to creative on

[2:47 - 2:52] Protocol things like our version one interface. We did a whole bunch of creative stuff around

[2:52 - 2:59] Noster and we kind of think got a little bit ahead of ourselves because what we ended up running into was actually a similar

[2:59 - 3:07] Problem to what we ran into with GPU topia before this, which is we had a bunch of supply lined up like when we did our GPU topia

[3:07 - 3:10] Our sort of decentralized GPU compute network using lightning

[3:11 - 3:17] We had a whole bunch of sellers on a whole bunch of compute sellers happily come by and want to sell compute

[3:18 - 3:20] contributing it to our open AI compatible

[3:20 - 3:27] API endpoint that supported inference fine tuning embedding and image generation the problem there was that we just didn't have any real

[3:27 - 3:28] Bison demand lined up

[3:30 - 3:37] It was difficult at that time to be competing against sort of the sort of like VC subsidized race to the bottom in terms of infrastructure

[3:37 - 3:45] Prices back when we were like specifically trying to pitch this API and we ran into like pretty much the same problem with the version one of our agent store

[3:45 - 3:47] Which is it was great that we had the ability

[3:47 - 3:49] Technically to have people be able to contribute

[3:50 - 3:56] Agent plugins to this marketplace and have you know some usage on the front end and have the lightning paid out

[3:56 - 4:02] Go to the people that were building the plugin the problem was that we were kind of pitching that at this sort of like consumer audience

[4:02 - 4:07] Where it wasn't really clear what they would want to use it for we'd kind of hope that sort of

[4:07 - 4:12] Like market forces would figure it out and market forces did not really figure it out

[4:12 - 4:15] And maybe that was just mismanagement on our part or not doing or saying the right things

[4:15 - 4:19] But the kind of like lesson that we learned from there is like okay

[4:19 - 4:25] We really need to start by focusing on what is the first use case for which people are actually willing to put down a credit card or

[4:25 - 4:29] You know chunk a Bitcoin and pay for real usage of something

[4:30 - 4:33] Our first kind of calculation that that would be coding agents

[4:33 - 4:38] So we built our version to coding agent just just to be like a really good workflow for

[4:38 - 4:44] Interacting with GitHub code base and being able to have you know an agent loop through and do meaningful things

[4:44 - 4:47] Over like a 90 second time window where

[4:47 - 4:51] People are able to be more productive as a developer here and that was okay. We had a few

[4:52 - 4:56] You know developers using this happily. I have been using it happily and heavily

[4:56 - 5:03] But the the real success in generating revenue came only recently when we started shifting to business customers

[5:03 - 5:10] People that have been either either having challenges hiring or they've got basically pain points that are not in the

[5:10 - 5:14] tens of dollars per month or the hundreds of dollars per month by their in the thousands of dollars per month

[5:15 - 5:17] So we've been using our sort of um

[5:17 - 5:18] agents

[5:19 - 5:26] Agent interface to auto-debt interface in this new pro interface sort of in this applied format directly to a few customers

[5:27 - 5:29] Call it a private beta or whatever

[5:30 - 5:30] um

[5:30 - 5:40] And that has addressed the thing that we had not had until this point which is what is the use case that people are willing to pay money for

[5:40 - 5:49] Now that we have that now that we have an idea of like what is the profile of the person the company that wants to pay

[5:49 - 5:54] Thousands of dollars a month for some sort of compound AI system that solves problems for them

[5:55 - 6:00] Now we can reason about okay, how do we extend that into things like you know

[6:00 - 6:05] Some of our customers want more than just the current integrations that we offer they might want something that goes to their

[6:05 - 6:14] Slack or just other types of things that you can imagine that this would be absolutely perfect for the whole agent plug-in idea that we like previously

[6:14 - 6:17] Speckdown built now to combine that in

[6:17 - 6:21] So anyway, we're we'll get to that in terms of like what we're doing next

[6:22 - 6:27] One of the other lessons was that the simplicity of the tech stack does not equal simplicity of development

[6:27 - 6:35] I have said even recently that I've gotten tired of certain of the like you know the big JavaScript and I've been really kind of taken by the

[6:35 - 6:37] the sort of swan song of

[6:37 - 6:43] You know siren song of of htmx and doing things simply and getting away from like big JavaScript and stuff

[6:44 - 6:47] And you know, you know, it was started with v1 with lara val

[6:47 - 6:58] Did v2 with versel and xjs and react v3 you know tried a bunch of different ways to use go or htmx or lara val without a bunch of like crazy JavaScript

[6:58 - 7:01] And I just came to the realization that

[7:02 - 7:06] It's really really really difficult to um be more productive

[7:08 - 7:11] Then what the you know vc batch companies are

[7:12 - 7:17] Spending a lot of time energy and resources to put into your hands in terms of specifically AI tooling

[7:17 - 7:21] The uh versel for example the versel a isdk

[7:21 - 7:27] Uh that powers this sort of chat and tool use of our version two and now version three interfaces um

[7:28 - 7:33] It's it's hard to beat. I've tried to recreate that in multiple different ways. I've got it like

[7:33 - 7:40] Working decently on the front end, but then the back end like there's just they solve a whole lot of stuff is really hard to get away from

[7:41 - 7:45] Um, so it's like all right one lesson is just like stop being cute

[7:45 - 7:52] We can get in the future when we want to do things in a different way and use I don't know other stacks, but like it's really

[7:53 - 8:02] Stop being cute about tech just do what's necessary to get the product out and that kind of gets to like yeah product before protocol or like

[8:02 - 8:04] you know

[8:07 - 8:13] Letting my my inner computer nerd that wants to do like the cutting edge that no one else is doing or like

[8:13 - 8:16] BHTmx to be funnily contrarian like I want to do that

[8:16 - 8:19] I spiritually want to be doing that but like

[8:19 - 8:22] realistically we got a ship product that um works

[8:22 - 8:25] uh if you know there's a new

[8:25 - 8:29] AI integration that comes out and versel adds it the next day instead of needing to build on myself

[8:29 - 8:32] It's just like the practicality of that has won out

[8:33 - 8:35] Uh, it's just like a principle that we need to hold um

[8:35 - 8:42] So some takeaways here are our core thesis is intact. I expressed in the opening video of this series like

[8:42 - 8:43] um

[8:43 - 8:52] We now agree basically with sam ultman this was done like the day after the open AI dev day presentation a year plus ago where

[8:52 - 8:52] um

[8:52 - 8:55] They're all talking about that the future was going to be agents

[8:55 - 8:55] I said you know

[8:55 - 8:57] I absolutely agree with that that

[8:58 - 8:59] This agents are the things that

[9:00 - 9:04] Businesses are going to be paying for people are going to be paying for and to take that one step further

[9:04 - 9:11] I believe that every person every business every family every street corner every device is going to have one or more

[9:11 - 9:20] agents AI agents basically compound AI systems working either on your behalf or as part of the system or as part of the device or part of the physical location

[9:21 - 9:22] agents will be

[9:22 - 9:27] Everywhere do you want these massive closed source

[9:27 - 9:29] corporations with

[9:29 - 9:34] poor incentives with every incentive to get their tendrils around the government

[9:34 - 9:40] Scare-monger about AI safety and try to erect barriers to keep out startups like we cannot let that happen this time

[9:40 - 9:47] It's the stakes are too high to mess with that level of you know interference with what should be an organic bottom-up

[9:47 - 9:48] evolutionary process so

[9:49 - 9:54] This general idea that everyone's gonna have agents and also that open

[9:55 - 10:02] Is going to be better than closed? I feel it's like fully strengthened and validated in that like these is

[10:02 - 10:07] Um which of these is going to win open versus closed? That's still an open question

[10:07 - 10:07] um

[10:07 - 10:08] I think that

[10:09 - 10:16] You know regardless of what you think about the election the fact that open AI's you know regulatory efforts and anthropic relative regulatory efforts

[10:17 - 10:21] Are probably going to be a lot less in impact?

[10:21 - 10:24] Because of what happened with the US election here where like the whole

[10:25 - 10:29] Big tech regulatory AI apparatus is just going to kind of fall on deaf ears

[10:29 - 10:30] um to some extent I mean

[10:31 - 10:32] you know

[10:33 - 10:35] Elon in there. It's just it's going to get interesting

[10:35 - 10:40] But the certainly the momentum is going to be on the side of the the builders and the the truly open

[10:40 - 10:45] Builders I think so our core thesis is intact. We're doing the right thing. We are I mean

[10:46 - 10:49] We're on it. We are we smell blood and we're

[10:50 - 10:54] We're coming after the uh the big fat unicorns

[10:54 - 10:57] Okay, uh other takeaway in

[10:58 - 11:01] Centivized interop matters um

[11:02 - 11:08] What we had when we had a bunch of like you know 20 different developers coming and writing plugins and and having that

[11:08 - 11:13] Process in place. It's like I could see very clearly that this is the future of

[11:13 - 11:16] How we build this sort of like unified

[11:17 - 11:24] Agent substrate that's usable by all people obviously this idea of sort of this operating system for all businesses is

[11:24 - 11:29] Probably larger of a scope than any single one person or company is going to be able to take on but

[11:30 - 11:37] We have certainly position at open agents to provide a leading role in that in part because we have an answer to this question of in center

[11:38 - 11:43] Incentivized interoperability and um I'm going to touch more on this in in the next few videos

[11:43 - 11:49] I think because this is like uh important to what we're going to be doing next as we start to reboot our plugin systems

[11:49 - 11:51] Uh, but this is actually a pretty good um

[11:52 - 11:57] A thread some agent develop investor guy was asking about stuff and um

[11:58 - 12:04] This conversation about people thinking that hey should we have this incentive mechanism for open source development for

[12:04 - 12:11] Participation in value capture as a way to like lubricate interactions between projects that are maybe working on the same thing

[12:11 - 12:13] Um, you know longer term consideration mobile

[12:14 - 12:19] You know the protocols and interrupt angle that this other person's asking about um

[12:19 - 12:24] Let me find this actually. This is probably good. Yeah, so is this not better suited as a protocol standardization issue

[12:24 - 12:31] Should these different agent providers conform to a portable and provider agnostic protocol or standard instead of not doing so like

[12:31 - 12:38] This is stuff that I've been grappling with specifically earlier in the series as it's like okay. We think that we see

[12:38 - 12:41] The broad strokes of how that needs to happen

[12:41 - 12:44] We think that bitcoin obviously pays an important role in for agent payments

[12:44 - 12:51] Nostra for agent communication and doing plugin registries like you know more on that well earlier in the series and soon um

[12:53 - 12:59] And so you know some other founder here's out is saying hey, you know, how can we do this should be allocate equity to OS

[12:59 - 13:02] S contributors and my thing is like well

[13:02 - 13:04] We think that revenue sharing is better than equity

[13:05 - 13:11] Compensating agent builders fairly in real time proportional to the value that they create as measured by and so like we did that piece

[13:11 - 13:13] But as measured by

[13:14 - 13:21] What customers mainly businesses with real budgets are willing to pay for so if we have one platform called open agents

[13:21 - 13:28] That solves the distribution for them because we have one beautiful amazing reputable brand and open agents.com and like companies

[13:28 - 13:30] They're gonna feel comfortable like all right like I'll pay open agents

[13:30 - 13:36] I'll load up some credits and then how does that get spent how it gets spent is answered in part by

[13:36 - 13:40] Us doing a little bit of the infrastructure

[13:40 - 13:47] But the bulk of the sort of like long tail of okay, I want to build an agent that has this integration knows about this data set

[13:48 - 13:49] And you know

[13:49 - 13:54] This configuration of things that some of which may require very niche

[13:55 - 13:58] Level knowledge or integration to have that provided by someone

[13:59 - 14:05] Agent developer plug-in someone who contributes data or whatever who has it now a mechanism to upload that

[14:05 - 14:10] And get rewarded proportional to that we think that that is the future. We build a bunch of infrastructure for that

[14:10 - 14:16] We had not yet connected it to revenue streams and that is what we are now about to do

[14:16 - 14:19] Okay, so anything else that I want to say here

[14:20 - 14:25] No, so you'll see more from us over the next few weeks

[14:25 - 14:29] We're going to be rolling out more in this incentivized interrupt

[14:30 - 14:34] Direction kind of rebooting our old plug-in system and connecting it to our

[14:36 - 14:37] Business dashboard here

[14:39 - 14:43] The work continues. I mean, there's still a lot a lot a lot more to do

[14:43 - 14:45] There's a lot of stuff that we didn't really fully do like

[14:46 - 14:51] Building on fully open models. We're still like kind of heavily dependent on clawed for a bunch of stuff

[14:51 - 14:56] But I think that adds the prompts and our sort of like prompt library and plug-in library get better a lot of that

[14:56 - 15:02] Can work with llama just like to the extent that that is a thing that people want to pay for like having the open marketplace where that

[15:02 - 15:05] Kind of like incentivized collaboration can

[15:06 - 15:09] Happened in one place. So one thing that I want to say also as a belief

[15:10 - 15:18] And I'll actually add this to our takeaways. I do strongly believe like the future of agent builders the future of agents

[15:19 - 15:20] is multiplayer

[15:22 - 15:29] Building all of this and using all of this is going to be best by incentivizing

[15:29 - 15:33] Contributors to work together. So we're not all reinventing the wheel

[15:33 - 15:36] We're not inventing the 15th agent framework

[15:36 - 15:41] It's like how do we start speaking the same language? I think the

[15:41 - 15:44] The how of how that happens is through

[15:44 - 15:52] You know a neutral agnostic data protocol, which we'll call Noster and how you kind of lubricate the incentives of that

[15:52 - 15:57] How do you incentivize the participation as you pay people you pay people what you pay them money

[15:57 - 16:03] What do you not pay them you don't pay them a fucking shit coin some Chuck E cheese coupon token that someone just made up

[16:03 - 16:09] You pay them real money. How do you get real money? You have customers pay you for it

[16:09 - 16:14] Not that everyone needs to pay us in Bitcoin. You can pay us in dollars. We'll pay out and big like we'll figure that part out

[16:14 - 16:23] But we think that the future of agents is multiplayer and that's on the sort of like provision of service side and also on the

[16:23 - 16:31] The usage side so teams. I mean, I think that the teams products of chat GPT and Anthropic are very limited

[16:31 - 16:37] I think there's so much room for expansion particularly into more of the kind of standard productivity

[16:37 - 16:44] of things like Microsoft teams like why should you have people have separate like calendar apps or chat apps or all this bullshit

[16:44 - 16:53] Like don't you want just like one dashboard like I do most of my work these days now in this interface and with this now teams integration

[16:53 - 16:54] Now if I have two different

[16:54 - 16:55] um

[16:56 - 16:57] People have on the same team

[16:58 - 17:00] That can have the same chat window open

[17:01 - 17:03] They can see the same chats coming in that's live right now

[17:03 - 17:07] Um, it's still kind of invite only for people that are like paying us and working with us

[17:07 - 17:13] If you want to get access to this just shoot me a dm. We'll open this up more broadly over the coming weeks

[17:13 - 17:13] but um

[17:14 - 17:16] Yeah, I think the future is multiplayer

[17:16 - 17:18] There's gonna be a lot more that can be done with like

[17:18 - 17:20] letting people see

[17:20 - 17:26] agents working like what is the visibility into what agents are out there working maybe we want to have

[17:26 - 17:34] agents where I have a particular research task that I want to do on something that is of importance to let's just say like

[17:34 - 17:37] You know some public policy issue in the United States

[17:37 - 17:42] I want to have some agents do some research and maybe I formulate the question and I like get the agent all set up

[17:42 - 17:44] And you could see that it's doing good work

[17:44 - 17:48] But it costs money for compute so maybe someone who cares about that issue wants to like donate some Bitcoin to have it keep going

[17:48 - 17:54] And have all this kind of happen more in public. We have we are to this point over the last year

[17:54 - 17:58] Still completely missing the idea of actual collaboration

[18:00 - 18:05] incentivized collaboration in the agent space and I think we're really well positioned to do that

[18:05 - 18:10] Um, stay tuned. Thanks so much. Happy for any feedback questions insults and we'll see you soon
