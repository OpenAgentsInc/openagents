## Full Transcript

So let's show a simple example of a data vending machine. This is NosterNip90. We'll do some technical dive into the specification later in the video. But first, a little video. And the big idea here is that we can consume AI services from a mobile app, not just hitting one server, one trusted server. You got to wonder about what they're doing with the data. But we can go out to an open and decentralized network. So here's an example of me just saying, hey, right, a high coup about artificial intelligence. We're getting some high coups back in this case from the GROC, GROQ API, that I've set up on an example back end server that's advertising to this decentralized network called Noster, via the NIP89 that goes with NIP90. And this will do the job. So let's just show an example. Let's do a high coup about Argentina. And that's going to create a job. And right now we just got a list of all of the jobs on this feed here. I might need to refresh it. All right, generate a high coup about Argentina. And if you see over here, we saw processing requests from the beginning of the pubkey request completed. So this sent out a request to the Noster network currently using this Dommus Relay, one of the relay of one of the most popular Noster clients, open and accessible. The server, the kind of like little server that I have here, is listening to that in the same way that anyone could listen to that. So right now I have it so that this is like satisfying the job, but anyone could satisfy the job. And we have our little high coup right there. Why this matters is because this allows for competition, particularly when there's payment involved. I will do payment in the next video. But just a little bit of more of about why. Here's another client, one of the main clients that speaks this NIP90 from the creator of the NIP90 protocol. Or you know, it's like an author of the sub protocol in the 90s. That's part of the Noster protocol. And what is the data vetting machine? It's a data processing tool. You give them some data, a few pieces of Bitcoin and stats, and they give you back some data. The magic of DBMs comes from a few key properties. They're discoverable. So jobs don't need to be specifically directed to any DVM. Users simply request a certain job to be done and available. DBMs put pick it up. Composable jobs don't need to be that's just duplicate of there. You can combine multiple jobs in one. A one request could be do some analysis that could be strung together by a whole bunch of other jobs. Here's where AI agents and kind of tools and pathfinding smart discovery of tools. And DVMs will help with that to have that kind of be automated. And then ruthless competition. There's no registration, no sign-ups or approvals. The fact that anyone can create a DVM and immediately monetize it with zero intermediaries in an ever growing marketplace that is beating new users coming from all types of use cases in mind. Means that the DVM market is the freest market of data processing. AI is in the world. So our little test example here is on our GitHub. We're going to tie this into MCP in a video later this week. And then the Noster and Nip90 is on the Noster protocol. You can read Noster GitHub. You can read the actual specification. And then the website data vending machines.org has more introduction as well as other types of things that are being done currently on the Noster Network, translation, summarization, generalization, generation, software analysis, analytics, discovery, other. All sorts of stuff. So this is extensible by market forces. And it enables things like, remember, I gave the example in yesterday's video about, let's say someone in EU doesn't have access to Sora. But they'd be willing to pay $1, $5 for a particular image. Well, that's something that they can just say what they're willing to pay and whoever provides that gets paid. So one market globally connected decentralized on an unstoppable neutral protocol that works, you know, a combination of Noster with the logical payment mechanism here, which is Bitcoin. So how are we going to get Bitcoin connected to this? We will show that and talk through that in tomorrow's video. Stay tuned.

[0:00 - 0:05] So let's show a simple example of a data vending machine. This is NosterNip90.

[0:06 - 0:10] We'll do some technical dive into the specification later in the video.

[0:10 - 0:17] But first, a little video. And the big idea here is that we can consume AI services

[0:17 - 0:23] from a mobile app, not just hitting one server, one trusted server.

[0:24 - 0:25] You got to wonder about what they're doing with the data.

[0:26 - 0:28] But we can go out to an open and decentralized network.

[0:28 - 0:33] So here's an example of me just saying, hey, right, a high coup about artificial intelligence.

[0:34 - 0:40] We're getting some high coups back in this case from the GROC, GROQ API,

[0:41 - 0:48] that I've set up on an example back end server that's advertising to this decentralized network called Noster,

[0:48 - 0:56] via the NIP89 that goes with NIP90. And this will do the job.

[0:56 - 1:01] So let's just show an example. Let's do a high coup about Argentina.

[1:03 - 1:08] And that's going to create a job. And right now we just got a list of all of the jobs on this feed here.

[1:09 - 1:11] I might need to refresh it.

[1:13 - 1:17] All right, generate a high coup about Argentina. And if you see over here,

[1:17 - 1:22] we saw processing requests from the beginning of the pubkey request completed.

[1:22 - 1:28] So this sent out a request to the Noster network currently using this Dommus Relay,

[1:28 - 1:34] one of the relay of one of the most popular Noster clients, open and accessible.

[1:35 - 1:45] The server, the kind of like little server that I have here, is listening to that in the same way that anyone could listen to that.

[1:45 - 1:50] So right now I have it so that this is like satisfying the job, but anyone could satisfy the job.

[1:50 - 1:52] And we have our little high coup right there.

[1:53 - 2:00] Why this matters is because this allows for competition, particularly when there's payment involved.

[2:01 - 2:07] I will do payment in the next video. But just a little bit of more of about why.

[2:08 - 2:17] Here's another client, one of the main clients that speaks this NIP90 from the creator of the NIP90 protocol.

[2:17 - 2:22] Or you know, it's like an author of the sub protocol in the 90s. That's part of the Noster protocol.

[2:24 - 2:27] And what is the data vetting machine? It's a data processing tool.

[2:27 - 2:32] You give them some data, a few pieces of Bitcoin and stats, and they give you back some data.

[2:33 - 2:36] The magic of DBMs comes from a few key properties. They're discoverable.

[2:37 - 2:40] So jobs don't need to be specifically directed to any DVM.

[2:41 - 2:43] Users simply request a certain job to be done and available.

[2:43 - 2:49] DBMs put pick it up. Composable jobs don't need to be that's just duplicate of there.

[2:50 - 2:52] You can combine multiple jobs in one.

[2:54 - 3:01] A one request could be do some analysis that could be strung together by a whole bunch of other jobs.

[3:02 - 3:08] Here's where AI agents and kind of tools and pathfinding smart discovery of tools.

[3:09 - 3:13] And DVMs will help with that to have that kind of be automated.

[3:14 - 3:17] And then ruthless competition. There's no registration, no sign-ups or approvals.

[3:17 - 3:26] The fact that anyone can create a DVM and immediately monetize it with zero intermediaries in an ever growing marketplace that is beating new users coming from all types of use cases in mind.

[3:26 - 3:29] Means that the DVM market is the freest market of data processing.

[3:30 - 3:31] AI is in the world.

[3:32 - 3:37] So our little test example here is on our GitHub.

[3:38 - 3:43] We're going to tie this into MCP in a video later this week.

[3:46 - 3:49] And then the Noster and Nip90 is on the Noster protocol.

[3:50 - 3:53] You can read Noster GitHub. You can read the actual specification.

[3:54 - 4:00] And then the website data vending machines.org has more introduction as well as other types of

[4:02 - 4:13] things that are being done currently on the Noster Network, translation, summarization, generalization, generation, software analysis, analytics, discovery, other.

[4:14 - 4:15] All sorts of stuff.

[4:16 - 4:18] So this is extensible by market forces.

[4:19 - 4:28] And it enables things like, remember, I gave the example in yesterday's video about, let's say someone in EU doesn't have access to Sora.

[4:28 - 4:35] But they'd be willing to pay $1, $5 for a particular image.

[4:36 - 4:42] Well, that's something that they can just say what they're willing to pay and whoever provides that gets paid.

[4:43 - 4:58] So one market globally connected decentralized on an unstoppable neutral protocol that works, you know, a combination of Noster with the logical payment mechanism here, which is Bitcoin.

[4:58 - 5:01] So how are we going to get Bitcoin connected to this?

[5:01 - 5:05] We will show that and talk through that in tomorrow's video.

[5:06 - 5:06] Stay tuned.
