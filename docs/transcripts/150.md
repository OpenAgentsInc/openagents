Welcome to the 12th and final night of Open Agents. You know, we said two weeks ago, we're going to launch a mobile app in two weeks. We're going to do 12 nights of Open Agents. And by night 12, we'll launch the coolest, awesome, best-disked open-source, truly open AI agent app and product that should bootstrap a global decentralized AI agent's marketplace. We did! The app isn't there yet. Clearly, we've got a lot more to do. But we have an app. It's out. You can use it. We just did the first update today. We'll talk a little bit about that. But yeah, I just want to step through some thoughts about what Open AI has released and what we've released and what we're going to do moving forward. First of all, OpenAgence.com has the updated download links. Test flight lags behind Android, depending on the review schedule. So if you sign up for that, you'll still only have 0.01 until they approve the review. Android, you can go click and read the release notes and download it via the APK link right there or do directly either. I just added some stability. We added Lama 3.2 B so you can click models up there and switch between the two models. You can delete them from your phone, download them there. So it should just be a little smoother better. Okay, connect, blah, blah, blah, blah, that all works fine. So let's take a look. What did OpenA AI release today? What did they release today? Okay, here's what I wanted them to release. Wait, wait, wait. This is what I wanted them to release. Mr. Photo here says he was guessing that, oh, before he left OpenA AI, Andrea Capethi said he's building a kind of Jarvis at OpenA AI and he said, that's my guess. I said, I would really hope that they do that too because closed AI building a Jarvis versus OpenAgence building a Jarvis. That's the whole idea behind Onyx. It's your personal Jarvis in your pocket. Let's compete about that. This is the fight that I want. This 150 video series had began as a response to OpenA AI's GPT store, which I thought they were going to half ass and do shitty. We're going to do our own version, basically, of OpenA AI's product suite starting with GPT store in an open way. That's what we've been kind of cranking on for the last year. So it's like, okay, let's battle about Jarvis. What did they actually ship? A blog post. I was all thinking, oh, they might do GPT 4.5 or Agent or Task or something like. We've got a cool model. We took a model and we combined it with a bunch of other kind of chains of thought into one big trench coat and we called it a model and we spent millions of dollars, a million millions of tokens and $10,000 on tokens. Yeah, it's going to be great. Here's some pieces of paper. It says it's going to be great. Great job, OpenA AI. So they shipped eVals for a reason or model. We are shipping Jarvis as an app anyone in the world can use. Let's check in this time next year to see which mattered more. It's a smiley face. So I'm calling this video, NeutralityWinds because I want to introduce this concept and there have been a few other concepts called the principles that we've gone over. We've kind of fleshed out of the last year and I want to add this one to it. Anything else I want to go into before that? Now let's start here. Okay, so let's just kind of recap. So OpenAgence, top left. What are we doing here? Well, AI agents will soon outnumber humans. There will be billions of these things. Elon says he's going to be, he thinks they'll be producing like a billion Optimus robots per year. So if robots are going to outnumber humans in the next decade or two, you better believe agents will get their first because software is going to be a lot more of an advantage. So I hope that we know a majority of those are doing what their code is what their data is what their weights is. So for true AI safety, we need those agents to be as open as possible. That's potentially existential. You can envision all sorts of bad scenarios ranging from Orwellian dystopia to agents interfering with like nuclear weapons. Who knows? But like we got to know these agents are doing open agents agents should be open. Let's do that. One market. So we did a video on this. We are liberating fronts here. AI from captured centralize corporations who will not be building open agents by building one decentralized global marketplace of AI agents services. You can read our one market video last week for more on the thesis of that. Part of how we build one market is through this concept of incentivize interrupt. So we're building this sort of like one we think one agent centric web. There's a bunch of people like companies now trying to build infrastructure to help companies kind of speak agent or let agents traverse the data of a bunch of different companies. I think a whole bunch of different people are going to be kind of plugging things into this one broader call agent centric web. And I think that it's going to have its own network effect and that network effect is going to reward people who make the web traversable or who can traverse the web bringing down friction for agents because agents are going to want to have access to the more things that they can access the more valuable. They'll be and anyone who's not participating this who's just sitting behind a walled garden will not get the benefits of this. So if you cooperate you get paid because people are going to be we think transacting more and more in this more open and agente. If you client to participate just trying like shore up your mode if you're just going to sit behind your big walls as the public company and counter your money I think that's going to diminish. And then how you weaken more directly kind of encourage people to join this network is by just paying them paying them revs. Share hey if you refer us a client we're going to give you a stream of the Bitcoin stream of whatever they pass to you in Bitcoin on a recurring basis forever. That's a pretty compelling selling point I think to start kind of building up this one network that has these kind of like streams of micro payments going out permissionlessly in Bitcoin to everybody all the time. Bitcoin only Bitcoin is the logical payment mechanism currency and payment more importantly payment rails that we think a lot of the machine to machine payments a lot of the agent payments are just good they're going to be coming to Bitcoin. There is always going to be some shit pointers that are doing things but I think if you haven't seen this talk if you look on YouTube for the Bitcoin stack great talk from Bitcoin 2021 to help open my eyes about oh actually a lot of the kinds of things that are being built in these unstable ways on change other than Bitcoin are going to be migrating and you already see a start to see this happen to the Bitcoin stack generally not necessarily to the base layer of Bitcoin but to Bitcoin and the like different layers that are kind of being built around that. So Bitcoin layers like layer two like lightning for fast payments as well as adges and things like noster and other kind of key based structures here. Okay so the other concept that I want to throw out there is we'll call it neutrality wins and we've kind of seen some of this with the phrase model like no stick like we have had like our very first product with open agents was we're putting out a chat interface that allows you to use open AI models and clawed models with the same interface this was solving my own pain point back a year plus ago where I was like with clawed three I just come out and I was like paying open AI $20 a month as paying a clawed $20 a month like why don't I just build a single interface that just use the APIs and then that was our first product we charged $10 a month that's cool we can do that we it's great to be model like no stick just use whatever's the best you know at one point we had like you know 15 different models from seven different providers and that was really cool the big labs are not going to do that Google is not going to use Anthropics models open AI is not going to use Google's models like these people are fighting each other for turf you know bad for them good for us so we'll have the like category defining industry defining products and apps that use these AI models are they going to think so they're not set up for that so a neutral player can use it all neutrality prevents rent seeking and enables value for guys so rent seeking would be like hey use my web 3 protocol we built an agent framework you'll use a token I hold a bunch of the token this will enrich me and maybe you'll get some token that's kind of the pitch of a lot of these web 3 companies building frameworks that use a token it's a completely graphed on like bolt on bullshit like oh use my token with a token has no actual utility but they make something it's like the function of a lot of that shit pointer is is just to enrich the founding team and it's not neutral and I've been in this position and I'm vocal about this because that that used to be me like I ran one of those projects seven years ago I've seen in retrospect how much it warps your thinking it takes you away from shipping product and solving people's actual problems and you think you have a big incentive to think in terms of like what pumps the price of my token and then you attract a whole bunch of people around you who are like also caring about that primarily it does not lend itself to like shipping product and delivering delivering real value so that kind of both like token based crap as well as there's a bunch of on the other side like VC backed companies that are building kind of what you'd call proprietary picks and jubbles companies where they think that people are going to use their infrastructure or framework or something to build agents like no no not necessarily if I need to like get an API key from you to run my business I'm not going to do that I have the same access to this technology that pretty much anyone else does so why build dependencies on third parties particularly when they're incentives are not going to be aligned with yours if you're building on one of those companies and they sell the Google tomorrow which is like when a lot of these companies would count as a win selling out to the fucking evil empire people that are trying to like play regulatory capture games like we don't want to build we can't build on that we have to build on things that are neutral and that are rock solid what's rock solid Bitcoin is rock solid lightning is rock solid the companies that are building on those tend to be rock solid because they're building it's harder to raise money after actually run good businesses like it just people are higher integrity just the Bitcoin space makes sense for this and then you know technically aside from the Bitcoin and kind of payments related things to use data there's like equivalents that kind of are in line with the Bitcoin principles like noster there's other public key cryptography things like that we're using noster at least to start but as you saw like in the noster data vending machines video this is a great way for projects to be able to rapidly use the same standards to build up kind of this idea of one market one liquidity like right now you've got 15 different noster clients a lot of them kind of Twitter clones or other kind of takes on social media apps and because they all speak noster they all have access to the same pool of data it's like one liquidity pool one pool of posts and this gets around the cold start problem if you have an idea for a client where you want a particular algorithm to be a particular way you have actually the same data that everybody else does you just have your client then pull in the data that you want it's really powerful and I expect to see that kind of concept apply also to AI services why are you going to trust that some particular company is going to build up their own agent marketplace and have their own network effect that's better than what the accumulated everyone else collectively working together is going to do no no single company is going to be able to outperform what everyone else working together can do as it's kind of the major theme here it's like don't do one thing by yourself let's figure out how to build on these has to be neutral open protocols and that lends itself to all sorts of cool things where I don't need to do everything myself I'll give an example of Jority from Fusatz also doing Bitcoin Lightning kind of agent infrastructure stuff a year ago I was saying I need to hire an L402 expert to build out our infrastructure that has the like lightning payments that work with our agents and like well let me raise no eight a second me Jority figure out what he's doing and what he'll be good doing and what I'll be good at doing is like oh he's the guy that's like the expert that if I need to talk to someone about that or work with him that solves that piece because we're both building on Bitcoin and lightning we know that all of us the tech that decisions that we're making are going to be interoperable with each other interoperability that matters a lot AI similar thing huge props to anthropic for putting out that model context protocol we did a video on that um the future is open protocols and it was a little surprising to me that anthropic which has been you know I've had kind of a love hate relationship with because I love sonnet I use it so much and then their Daria is one of these people flying the DC and scaring the hell out of the regulators about AI safety in this bullshit so it's like love hate relationship but the fact that they threw their chips on hey we're going to build this open protocol nothing in it is tied a proprietary to anthropic so like you can have open protocols that have companies backing them and I envision that we will probably do something similar where we may put out some particular specification or set of standards as a protocol probably grafting on to NOSTER for example like I've written one and a half NIP's NOSTER improvement protocols in the past so I'm a contributor to the protocol I can very easily probably write another specification specifically for if we decide that the things that we're doing in agent land need some specific um specification for products to be able to speak the same language that's not covered by the existing NIP's then we can just write that and add it and that'll be voluntary and opt in in the same way that the rest of the NOSTER ecosystem is um but it's not like anyone's going to be subject to what a company does you can take the pieces that you like and leave off a piece that you don't like so taking together these are really the five principle that drive our decisions as open agents and just to give a little more color on this just a few tweets um so DAX prominent developer guy says you don't pay for SaaS for the code they wrote otherwise open source clones would always win you pay for operating the SaaS but the cost of operating software is being driven to zero it's becoming self operating what happens then then everything collapses into one market built on open protocols facilitating interop and minimizing friction so agents can access all of it think blocks tv decks but for data tools workflows business logic customer relationships you can google that for their white paper to read about building this decentralized exchange it's like a web of different providers making different tradeoffs around custody and such agents won't sign up for your wait list and they won't talk to your salespeople we will rebuild your companies whole product suite in that time and connect it to the one market that solves distribution for all participants the midwit VC takes about vertical agents thinking vertical agents will look like sasted the why commenter people specifically predicted that vertical agents will produce 300 unicorns in 20 years just like sasted but that I think there's no fucking way agents will conquer all verticals but there's no reason for that to be 300 separate siloed companies how is anyone gonna one company going to compete with the accumulated mass of everyone else in the world trying to solve that same problem crowds incentivize interoperability building on a single protocol stack that's neutral markets markets market it will all collapse to one market on neutral open protocols no VC blockchains or proprietary picks and shovels and on the open monetary network Bitcoin only so no she coins need ever unicorns axes robots were coming after the unicorns we want them we're hungry yeah this is the yc like interview that I was responding to where they're like main agent guy was like oh well there will be 300 agent unicorns no you would love there to be 300 agent unicorns because you'll get a piece of a bunch of them but I don't think so I don't think so nice thread here on software engineers and but also mentioning that magic phrase network effect which will continue to exist this is key who else is talking about network effect in the agent space this is my background like gig marketplace ride share stuff like thinking about network effect I think about this a lot and like how do you bring network effect into agents well we think the agent center web will have its own meta network effect rewarding those who make the web traversable to agents connected into one market punishing non participants of that interoperability eroding the modes of today's companies in their world gardens we think a lot of current companies and startups playing yesterday's game my combinator and vertical agents will not survive that transition to the agentic web how are you gonna fend off like the agents of everyone else in the world pooling their like dragon ball z freaking spirit energy behind the bit coinized open agents we're coming after all of that business oh this VC is wants to back this vertical agent company don't attack it fuck that I want that business we're gonna serve it better than you are like let's fight about it you like hey this is a nice tweet none of the big labs have shipped anything resembling lifelong memory they haven't really even shipped rag none of the open source stuff works well enough to be useful without intense fiddling for very constrained workflows this is the real bottleneck now not intelligence yeah just like boring business stuff but with the theme of not having not having everyone reinvent the wheel not inventing the 28th agent agent framework that no one's gonna fucking use pay incentivize people aka pay people to work together build win win relationships establish what the revenue flows are and then just go fold other people in and fucking share the money easy another good question from soren here apps of corner UX over supply networks like restaurants hotels trails instead of how do you induce these to appear as APIs well I think when that met a network effect contains sub networks for restaurants apply or any vertical that becomes competitive with established players some legacy orgs and apps maybe forced the negotiating table to join that's where maybe they call up open agents throw us a sack of money to get them to connect it say to be able to contribute to and benefit from the barter network or they'll just watch their networks of road and just play defense until we join call their network you can see a hint of this happening now where Doris he's been trying to get Elon to make X in one master client which what Doris he was trying to do before he left Twitter but imagine that conversation happening with thousands and then millions of people in agents all trying to get established companies plugging into that one market which they'll do because they get paid the best most fastest with open agents if you're an agent builder why are you going to go build for free somewhere else or some project trying to pay you in their fucking shit coin chucky cheese token that they're going to dump at the first opportunity when you can get paid like permanent lifetime revenue share commission on stuff that you build instant micro payments actual money aka Bitcoin like you're going to want that one so call us a contrarian bet but I envision over the next five to ten years almost all enterprise value leaking out of legacy orgs apps anything into decentralized networks co-op substrate startups that are plugged into that one market kind of a similar game theory to Bitcoin everyone has incentive to help onboard the next folks connecting to one network and the earlier you get in the better position you'll be to get a bigger piece of the pie and this is fun growing day is oh three one of those models where people compete to soy face the loudest when it comes out and then I deploy it in the field and it's actually just kind of crappy oh my gosh I got one more tweet I wanted to read this one here Evan from founder of SF computer so test time scaling probably means the models will be open source not closed source it shifts the cost from catbacks to opx which is not beneficial for the closed source labs meta and others are likely going to continue to release open source models in order to commoditize their complement or think they're commoditizing their complement if training scale blah blah catbacks blah blah blah so nice analysis AI is everywhere scenarios now lots and lots of open source or cheap models will exist but be run for longer run for longer run for longer here's another tweet I'm taking this I'm taking this I'm taking this phrase from simphorcer toshi doing the truffle thing but he had a saying that says the local AI is infinite test time compute this oh one model just doing all this test time compute everyone's like test time computes how we like get to the next scaling mountain whatever and that's just when you're doing the inference just letting it infer more well if you have a device where the model is running on your device the only payment is I mean your battery so there's some electricity cost there but I can sit here on my phone and run llama 3.2 and just plug it in and just have it run and have it think about 30 different things in a row but what if they can think not just thoughts of itself but they can tap into different larger models or different people using tools or different these idea of these data venting machines and like different specialist models or specialist MCP servers like we just need to stop thinking about what one person's gonna be able to do cobbling all this stuff together themselves like let's kind of brainstorm about how to have each person be able to tap into a broad network of these things all marketplace so very excited about edge compute powering long lives open agents local to your device so we are at episode 150 of open agents we're gonna keep it going that concludes the 12 nights of open agents I hope this has been entertaining or educational and stuff for you the app yeah it's definitely got a long way to go before it's like something we're comfortable putting into the app stores but you know long way to go just just means like a few weeks January probably so we try it out we will appreciate any feedback it should be improving rapidly next week we'll start to get into the more interesting stuff like the Bitcoin wallet and the decentralized marketplace pieces and just it'll continue feeling better designed as we go so thank you so much and I hope to have your participation and help as we build one market on neutral protocols and conquer the world see ya

[0:00 - 0:03] Welcome to the 12th and final night of Open Agents.

[0:03 - 0:08] You know, we said two weeks ago, we're going to launch a mobile app in two weeks.

[0:08 - 0:10] We're going to do 12 nights of Open Agents.

[0:11 - 0:14] And by night 12, we'll launch the coolest, awesome,

[0:14 - 0:18] best-disked open-source, truly open AI agent app and product that should

[0:18 - 0:22] bootstrap a global decentralized AI agent's marketplace.

[0:22 - 0:25] We did! The app isn't there yet. Clearly, we've got a lot more to do.

[0:26 - 0:29] But we have an app. It's out. You can use it.

[0:29 - 0:32] We just did the first update today. We'll talk a little bit about that.

[0:33 - 0:38] But yeah, I just want to step through some thoughts about what Open AI has released

[0:38 - 0:42] and what we've released and what we're going to do moving forward.

[0:43 - 0:46] First of all, OpenAgence.com has the updated download links.

[0:46 - 0:50] Test flight lags behind Android, depending on the review schedule.

[0:50 - 0:54] So if you sign up for that, you'll still only have 0.01 until they approve the review.

[0:55 - 1:01] Android, you can go click and read the release notes and download it via the APK link right there

[1:01 - 1:07] or do directly either. I just added some stability. We added Lama 3.2 B so you can click

[1:07 - 1:10] models up there and switch between the two models. You can delete them from your phone,

[1:10 - 1:14] download them there. So it should just be a little smoother better.

[1:14 - 1:17] Okay, connect, blah, blah, blah, blah, that all works fine.

[1:17 - 1:20] So let's take a look. What did OpenA AI release today?

[1:20 - 1:23] What did they release today? Okay, here's what I wanted them to release.

[1:23 - 1:26] Wait, wait, wait. This is what I wanted them to release.

[1:27 - 1:32] Mr. Photo here says he was guessing that, oh, before he left OpenA AI,

[1:32 - 1:37] Andrea Capethi said he's building a kind of Jarvis at OpenA AI and he said, that's my guess.

[1:38 - 1:44] I said, I would really hope that they do that too because closed AI building a Jarvis versus

[1:44 - 1:49] OpenAgence building a Jarvis. That's the whole idea behind Onyx. It's your personal Jarvis

[1:49 - 1:53] in your pocket. Let's compete about that. This is the fight that I want.

[1:53 - 2:01] This 150 video series had began as a response to OpenA AI's GPT store, which I thought

[2:01 - 2:06] they were going to half ass and do shitty. We're going to do our own version,

[2:06 - 2:10] basically, of OpenA AI's product suite starting with GPT store in an open way.

[2:10 - 2:12] That's what we've been kind of cranking on for the last year.

[2:12 - 2:16] So it's like, okay, let's battle about Jarvis. What did they actually ship?

[2:17 - 2:19] A blog post.

[2:20 - 2:26] I was all thinking, oh, they might do GPT 4.5 or Agent or Task or something like.

[2:27 - 2:35] We've got a cool model. We took a model and we combined it with a bunch of other kind of chains

[2:35 - 2:39] of thought into one big trench coat and we called it a model and we spent millions of dollars,

[2:39 - 2:44] a million millions of tokens and $10,000 on tokens. Yeah, it's going to be great.

[2:44 - 2:46] Here's some pieces of paper. It says it's going to be great.

[2:49 - 2:55] Great job, OpenA AI. So they shipped eVals for a

[2:55 - 3:01] reason or model. We are shipping Jarvis as an app anyone in the world can use.

[3:02 - 3:07] Let's check in this time next year to see which mattered more. It's a smiley face.

[3:09 - 3:12] So I'm calling this video,

[3:16 - 3:21] NeutralityWinds because I want to introduce this concept and there have been a few other

[3:22 - 3:28] concepts called the principles that we've gone over. We've kind of fleshed out of the last

[3:28 - 3:34] year and I want to add this one to it. Anything else I want to go into before that?

[3:34 - 3:37] Now let's start here. Okay, so let's just kind of recap.

[3:38 - 3:43] So OpenAgence, top left. What are we doing here? Well, AI agents will soon outnumber humans.

[3:44 - 3:49] There will be billions of these things. Elon says he's going to be, he thinks they'll be producing

[3:49 - 3:57] like a billion Optimus robots per year. So if robots are going to outnumber humans in the next

[3:57 - 4:04] decade or two, you better believe agents will get their first because software is going to

[4:05 - 4:10] be a lot more of an advantage. So I hope that we know a majority of those are doing what their code

[4:10 - 4:16] is what their data is what their weights is. So for true AI safety, we need those agents to be as open

[4:16 - 4:22] as possible. That's potentially existential. You can envision all sorts of bad scenarios ranging

[4:22 - 4:31] from Orwellian dystopia to agents interfering with like nuclear weapons. Who knows? But like we

[4:31 - 4:36] got to know these agents are doing open agents agents should be open. Let's do that.

[4:37 - 4:44] One market. So we did a video on this. We are liberating fronts here. AI from captured centralize

[4:44 - 4:52] corporations who will not be building open agents by building one decentralized global marketplace

[4:52 - 4:58] of AI agents services. You can read our one market video last week for more on the thesis of that.

[4:58 - 5:05] Part of how we build one market is through this concept of incentivize interrupt. So we're building

[5:05 - 5:11] this sort of like one we think one agent centric web. There's a bunch of people like companies now

[5:11 - 5:20] trying to build infrastructure to help companies kind of speak agent or let agents traverse the data

[5:20 - 5:23] of a bunch of different companies. I think a whole bunch of different people are going to be kind of

[5:23 - 5:28] plugging things into this one broader call agent centric web. And I think that it's going to have

[5:28 - 5:35] its own network effect and that network effect is going to reward people who make the web

[5:35 - 5:41] traversable or who can traverse the web bringing down friction for agents because agents are going

[5:41 - 5:46] to want to have access to the more things that they can access the more valuable. They'll be and

[5:46 - 5:50] anyone who's not participating this who's just sitting behind a walled garden will not get the

[5:50 - 5:55] benefits of this. So if you cooperate you get paid because people are going to be we think

[5:56 - 6:01] transacting more and more in this more open and agente. If you client to participate just trying

[6:01 - 6:06] like shore up your mode if you're just going to sit behind your big walls as the public company

[6:06 - 6:12] and counter your money I think that's going to diminish. And then how you weaken more directly

[6:12 - 6:17] kind of encourage people to join this network is by just paying them paying them revs. Share hey if

[6:17 - 6:22] you refer us a client we're going to give you a stream of the Bitcoin stream of whatever they

[6:22 - 6:28] pass to you in Bitcoin on a recurring basis forever. That's a pretty compelling selling point I

[6:28 - 6:34] think to start kind of building up this one network that has these kind of like streams of

[6:34 - 6:41] micro payments going out permissionlessly in Bitcoin to everybody all the time. Bitcoin only

[6:41 - 6:47] Bitcoin is the logical payment mechanism currency and payment more importantly payment rails

[6:48 - 6:51] that we think a lot of the machine to machine payments a lot of the agent payments are just good

[6:51 - 6:58] they're going to be coming to Bitcoin. There is always going to be some shit pointers that are

[6:58 - 7:04] doing things but I think if you haven't seen this talk if you look on YouTube for the Bitcoin

[7:04 - 7:10] stack great talk from Bitcoin 2021 to help open my eyes about oh actually a lot of the kinds of

[7:10 - 7:16] things that are being built in these unstable ways on change other than Bitcoin are going to be

[7:16 - 7:22] migrating and you already see a start to see this happen to the Bitcoin stack generally not necessarily

[7:22 - 7:27] to the base layer of Bitcoin but to Bitcoin and the like different layers that are kind of being built

[7:27 - 7:34] around that. So Bitcoin layers like layer two like lightning for fast payments as well as adges

[7:34 - 7:41] and things like noster and other kind of key based structures here. Okay so the other concept that

[7:41 - 7:48] I want to throw out there is we'll call it neutrality wins and we've kind of seen some of this

[7:50 - 7:57] with the phrase model like no stick like we have had like our very first product with open agents

[7:57 - 8:04] was we're putting out a chat interface that allows you to use open AI models and clawed models with

[8:04 - 8:08] the same interface this was solving my own pain point back a year plus ago where I was like

[8:08 - 8:14] with clawed three I just come out and I was like paying open AI $20 a month as paying a clawed

[8:14 - 8:19] $20 a month like why don't I just build a single interface that just use the APIs and then that was

[8:19 - 8:25] our first product we charged $10 a month that's cool we can do that we it's great to be model like

[8:25 - 8:29] no stick just use whatever's the best you know at one point we had like you know 15 different models

[8:29 - 8:35] from seven different providers and that was really cool the big labs are not going to do that

[8:35 - 8:42] Google is not going to use Anthropics models open AI is not going to use Google's models like these

[8:42 - 8:49] people are fighting each other for turf you know bad for them good for us so we'll have the like

[8:49 - 8:59] category defining industry defining products and apps that use these AI models are they going to

[8:59 - 9:09] think so they're not set up for that so a neutral player can use it all neutrality prevents rent

[9:09 - 9:18] seeking and enables value for guys so rent seeking would be like hey use my web 3 protocol we built

[9:18 - 9:26] an agent framework you'll use a token I hold a bunch of the token this will enrich me and maybe

[9:26 - 9:32] you'll get some token that's kind of the pitch of a lot of these web 3 companies building frameworks

[9:32 - 9:40] that use a token it's a completely graphed on like bolt on bullshit like oh use my token with a

[9:40 - 9:45] token has no actual utility but they make something it's like the function of a lot of that shit

[9:45 - 9:53] pointer is is just to enrich the founding team and it's not neutral and I've been in this position

[9:53 - 9:58] and I'm vocal about this because that that used to be me like I ran one of those projects seven

[9:58 - 10:06] years ago I've seen in retrospect how much it warps your thinking it takes you away from shipping

[10:06 - 10:11] product and solving people's actual problems and you think you have a big incentive to think

[10:12 - 10:16] in terms of like what pumps the price of my token and then you attract a whole bunch of people

[10:16 - 10:22] around you who are like also caring about that primarily it does not lend itself to like shipping

[10:22 - 10:31] product and delivering delivering real value so that kind of both like token based crap as well as

[10:31 - 10:36] there's a bunch of on the other side like VC backed companies that are building kind of what you'd

[10:36 - 10:40] call proprietary picks and jubbles companies where they think that people are going to use their

[10:42 - 10:51] infrastructure or framework or something to build agents like no no not necessarily if I need to

[10:51 - 10:59] like get an API key from you to run my business I'm not going to do that I have the same access to

[10:59 - 11:06] this technology that pretty much anyone else does so why build dependencies on third parties particularly

[11:06 - 11:09] when they're incentives are not going to be aligned with yours if you're building on one of those

[11:09 - 11:13] companies and they sell the Google tomorrow which is like when a lot of these companies would count as

[11:13 - 11:20] a win selling out to the fucking evil empire people that are trying to like play regulatory capture

[11:20 - 11:27] games like we don't want to build we can't build on that we have to build on things that are neutral

[11:27 - 11:34] and that are rock solid what's rock solid Bitcoin is rock solid lightning is rock solid the companies

[11:34 - 11:39] that are building on those tend to be rock solid because they're building it's harder to raise money

[11:39 - 11:45] after actually run good businesses like it just people are higher integrity just the Bitcoin space

[11:45 - 11:52] makes sense for this and then you know technically aside from the Bitcoin and kind of payments related

[11:52 - 11:59] things to use data there's like equivalents that kind of are in line with the Bitcoin principles

[11:59 - 12:06] like noster there's other public key cryptography things like that we're using noster at least to start

[12:06 - 12:13] but as you saw like in the noster data vending machines video this is a great way for projects to

[12:14 - 12:23] be able to rapidly use the same standards to build up kind of this idea of one market one liquidity

[12:23 - 12:29] like right now you've got 15 different noster clients a lot of them kind of Twitter clones or

[12:29 - 12:34] other kind of takes on social media apps and because they all speak noster they all have access to

[12:34 - 12:43] the same pool of data it's like one liquidity pool one pool of posts and this gets around the

[12:43 - 12:47] cold start problem if you have an idea for a client where you want a particular algorithm to be a

[12:47 - 12:51] particular way you have actually the same data that everybody else does you just have your client

[12:51 - 12:58] then pull in the data that you want it's really powerful and I expect to see that kind of concept

[12:58 - 13:05] apply also to AI services why are you going to trust that some particular company is going to build

[13:05 - 13:10] up their own agent marketplace and have their own network effect that's better than what the

[13:10 - 13:17] accumulated everyone else collectively working together is going to do no no single company is

[13:17 - 13:23] going to be able to outperform what everyone else working together can do as it's kind of the

[13:23 - 13:31] major theme here it's like don't do one thing by yourself let's figure out how to build on these

[13:32 - 13:38] has to be neutral open protocols and that lends itself to all sorts of cool things where I don't

[13:38 - 13:45] need to do everything myself I'll give an example of Jority from Fusatz also doing Bitcoin Lightning

[13:45 - 13:53] kind of agent infrastructure stuff a year ago I was saying I need to hire an L402 expert to build out

[13:53 - 13:59] our infrastructure that has the like lightning payments that work with our agents and like well

[13:59 - 14:05] let me raise no eight a second me Jority figure out what he's doing and what he'll be good doing

[14:05 - 14:10] and what I'll be good at doing is like oh he's the guy that's like the expert that if I need to

[14:10 - 14:16] talk to someone about that or work with him that solves that piece because we're both building on

[14:16 - 14:20] Bitcoin and lightning we know that all of us the tech that decisions that we're making are going

[14:20 - 14:29] to be interoperable with each other interoperability that matters a lot AI similar thing huge props to

[14:29 - 14:34] anthropic for putting out that model context protocol we did a video on that um the future is open

[14:34 - 14:40] protocols and it was a little surprising to me that anthropic which has been you know I've had kind

[14:40 - 14:45] of a love hate relationship with because I love sonnet I use it so much and then their

[14:46 - 14:51] Daria is one of these people flying the DC and scaring the hell out of the regulators about AI

[14:51 - 14:56] safety in this bullshit so it's like love hate relationship but the fact that they threw their chips

[14:56 - 15:02] on hey we're going to build this open protocol nothing in it is tied a proprietary to anthropic so

[15:02 - 15:08] like you can have open protocols that have companies backing them and I envision that we will probably

[15:08 - 15:15] do something similar where we may put out some particular specification or set of standards as a

[15:15 - 15:22] protocol probably grafting on to NOSTER for example like I've written one and a half NIP's NOSTER

[15:22 - 15:28] improvement protocols in the past so I'm a contributor to the protocol I can very easily probably write

[15:28 - 15:34] another specification specifically for if we decide that the things that we're doing in agent land

[15:34 - 15:41] need some specific um specification for products to be able to speak the same language that's

[15:41 - 15:46] not covered by the existing NIP's then we can just write that and add it and that'll be voluntary

[15:46 - 15:51] and opt in in the same way that the rest of the NOSTER ecosystem is um but it's not like anyone's

[15:51 - 15:57] going to be subject to what a company does you can take the pieces that you like and leave off a piece

[15:57 - 15:57] that you don't like

[16:02 - 16:10] so taking together these are really the five principle that drive our decisions as open agents

[16:10 - 16:16] and just to give a little more color on this just a few tweets um

[16:18 - 16:24] so DAX prominent developer guy says you don't pay for SaaS for the code they wrote otherwise open source

[16:24 - 16:28] clones would always win you pay for operating the SaaS but the cost of operating software is being

[16:28 - 16:36] driven to zero it's becoming self operating what happens then then everything collapses into one

[16:36 - 16:40] market built on open protocols facilitating interop and minimizing friction so agents can access

[16:40 - 16:49] all of it think blocks tv decks but for data tools workflows business logic customer relationships

[16:49 - 16:52] you can google that for their white paper to read about building this decentralized exchange it's

[16:52 - 16:57] like a web of different providers making different tradeoffs around custody and such agents won't

[16:57 - 17:01] sign up for your wait list and they won't talk to your salespeople we will rebuild your companies

[17:01 - 17:06] whole product suite in that time and connect it to the one market that solves distribution for all

[17:06 - 17:14] participants the midwit VC takes about vertical agents thinking vertical agents will look like

[17:14 - 17:20] sasted the why commenter people specifically predicted that vertical agents will produce 300 unicorns

[17:20 - 17:26] in 20 years just like sasted but that I think there's no fucking way agents will conquer all

[17:26 - 17:31] verticals but there's no reason for that to be 300 separate siloed companies how is anyone gonna

[17:31 - 17:38] one company going to compete with the accumulated mass of everyone else in the world trying to solve

[17:38 - 17:49] that same problem crowds incentivize interoperability building on a single protocol stack that's neutral

[17:52 - 18:01] markets markets market it will all collapse to one market on neutral open protocols no VC blockchains

[18:01 - 18:06] or proprietary picks and shovels and on the open monetary network Bitcoin only so no she coins

[18:06 - 18:12] need ever unicorns axes robots were coming after the unicorns we want them we're hungry

[18:15 - 18:20] yeah this is the yc like interview that I was responding to where they're like main agent guy

[18:20 - 18:26] was like oh well there will be 300 agent unicorns no you would love there to be 300 agent unicorns

[18:26 - 18:31] because you'll get a piece of a bunch of them but I don't think so I don't think so

[18:33 - 18:41] nice thread here on software engineers and but also mentioning that magic phrase network effect

[18:41 - 18:44] which will continue to exist

[18:47 - 18:55] this is key who else is talking about network effect in the agent space this is my background like

[18:55 - 19:00] gig marketplace ride share stuff like thinking about network effect I think about this a lot

[19:00 - 19:07] and like how do you bring network effect into agents well we think the agent center web will have

[19:07 - 19:14] its own meta network effect rewarding those who make the web traversable to agents connected into one

[19:14 - 19:20] market punishing non participants of that interoperability eroding the modes of today's companies

[19:20 - 19:26] in their world gardens we think a lot of current companies and startups playing yesterday's game

[19:27 - 19:32] my combinator and vertical agents will not survive that transition to the agentic web

[19:35 - 19:43] how are you gonna fend off like the agents of everyone else in the world pooling their like dragon

[19:43 - 19:53] ball z freaking spirit energy behind the bit coinized open agents we're coming after all of that

[19:53 - 20:00] business oh this VC is wants to back this vertical agent company don't attack it fuck that I want

[20:00 - 20:07] that business we're gonna serve it better than you are like let's fight about it you like

[20:09 - 20:19] hey this is a nice tweet none of the big labs have shipped anything resembling lifelong memory they

[20:19 - 20:24] haven't really even shipped rag none of the open source stuff works well enough to be useful without

[20:24 - 20:30] intense fiddling for very constrained workflows this is the real bottleneck now not intelligence

[20:30 - 20:36] yeah just like boring business stuff but with the theme of not having not having everyone reinvent

[20:36 - 20:41] the wheel not inventing the 28th agent agent framework that no one's gonna fucking use

[20:44 - 20:49] pay incentivize people aka pay people to work together build win win relationships establish

[20:49 - 20:55] what the revenue flows are and then just go fold other people in and fucking share the money easy

[20:59 - 21:03] another good question from soren here apps of corner UX over supply networks like restaurants

[21:03 - 21:09] hotels trails instead of how do you induce these to appear as APIs well I think when that met a

[21:09 - 21:13] network effect contains sub networks for restaurants apply or any vertical that becomes competitive

[21:13 - 21:18] with established players some legacy orgs and apps maybe forced the negotiating table to join

[21:18 - 21:23] that's where maybe they call up open agents throw us a sack of money to get them to connect it say

[21:23 - 21:29] to be able to contribute to and benefit from the barter network or they'll just watch their

[21:29 - 21:34] networks of road and just play defense until we join call their network you can see a hint of

[21:34 - 21:39] this happening now where Doris he's been trying to get Elon to make X in one master client which

[21:39 - 21:44] what Doris he was trying to do before he left Twitter but imagine that conversation happening with

[21:44 - 21:48] thousands and then millions of people in agents all trying to get established companies plugging into

[21:48 - 21:54] that one market which they'll do because they get paid the best most fastest with open agents if

[21:54 - 22:00] you're an agent builder why are you going to go build for free somewhere else or some project trying

[22:00 - 22:04] to pay you in their fucking shit coin chucky cheese token that they're going to dump at the first

[22:04 - 22:10] opportunity when you can get paid like permanent lifetime revenue share commission on stuff that you

[22:10 - 22:20] build instant micro payments actual money aka Bitcoin like you're going to want that one so call

[22:20 - 22:25] us a contrarian bet but I envision over the next five to ten years almost all enterprise value

[22:25 - 22:32] leaking out of legacy orgs apps anything into decentralized networks co-op substrate startups that

[22:32 - 22:37] are plugged into that one market kind of a similar game theory to Bitcoin everyone has incentive

[22:37 - 22:42] to help onboard the next folks connecting to one network and the earlier you get in

[22:43 - 22:46] the better position you'll be to get a bigger piece of the pie

[22:47 - 22:53] and this is fun growing day is oh three one of those models where people compete to soy face

[22:53 - 22:56] the loudest when it comes out and then I deploy it in the field and it's actually just kind of crappy

[23:01 - 23:06] oh my gosh I got one more tweet I wanted to read this one here

[23:07 - 23:16] Evan from founder of SF computer so test time scaling probably means the models will be open

[23:16 - 23:22] source not closed source it shifts the cost from catbacks to opx which is not beneficial for

[23:22 - 23:26] the closed source labs meta and others are likely going to continue to release open source models

[23:26 - 23:31] in order to commoditize their complement or think they're commoditizing their complement if training

[23:31 - 23:38] scale blah blah catbacks blah blah blah so nice analysis AI is everywhere scenarios now

[23:39 - 23:45] lots and lots of open source or cheap models will exist but be run for longer run for longer run

[23:45 - 23:57] for longer here's another tweet I'm taking this I'm taking this I'm taking this phrase from

[23:57 - 24:06] simphorcer toshi doing the truffle thing but he had a saying that says the local AI is

[24:07 - 24:14] infinite test time compute this oh one model just doing all this test time compute everyone's

[24:14 - 24:17] like test time computes how we like get to the next scaling mountain whatever

[24:19 - 24:25] and that's just when you're doing the inference just letting it infer more well

[24:26 - 24:31] if you have a device where the model is running on your device the only payment is I mean your

[24:31 - 24:39] battery so there's some electricity cost there but I can sit here on my phone and run llama 3.2

[24:39 - 24:45] and just plug it in and just have it run and have it think about 30 different things in a row

[24:46 - 24:50] but what if they can think not just thoughts of itself but they can tap into different larger models

[24:50 - 24:54] or different people using tools or different these idea of these data venting machines and like

[24:54 - 25:02] different specialist models or specialist MCP servers like we just need to stop thinking about what

[25:02 - 25:06] one person's gonna be able to do cobbling all this stuff together themselves like

[25:06 - 25:11] let's kind of brainstorm about how to have each person be able to tap into a broad network of

[25:11 - 25:19] these things all marketplace so very excited about edge compute powering long lives open agents

[25:19 - 25:30] local to your device so we are at episode 150 of open agents we're gonna keep it going that

[25:30 - 25:36] concludes the 12 nights of open agents I hope this has been entertaining or educational and stuff

[25:36 - 25:42] for you the app yeah it's definitely got a long way to go before it's like something we're

[25:42 - 25:48] comfortable putting into the app stores but you know long way to go just just means like a few weeks

[25:48 - 25:56] January probably so we try it out we will appreciate any feedback it should be improving rapidly

[25:56 - 26:01] next week we'll start to get into the more interesting stuff like the Bitcoin wallet and the

[26:01 - 26:10] decentralized marketplace pieces and just it'll continue feeling better designed as we go

[26:10 - 26:17] so thank you so much and I hope to have your participation and help as we build one

[26:18 - 26:23] market on neutral protocols and conquer the world see ya
