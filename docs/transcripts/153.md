## Full Transcript

Alright, we've got a basic app live. Onyx is looking a little nicer. It works with tools. You can code with it. It's nice. So we're getting ready to launch the version 0.1 version, which has a Bitcoin wallet using the Breeze SDK, Bitcoin and Lighting, as well as a NOSHA client. So we'll release this in a day or two. And we're gonna be doing some really interesting things with Bitcoin rewards and paying you for data and data vending machines and Bitcoin for referrals. Just gonna experiment a lot with different ways of paying you and letting you pay each other with Bitcoin in our 0.1 series of releases. And before we get too much into the weeds of beautiful Bitcoin integration, I wanted to kind of step through kind of how we're thinking about Bitcoin integration generally. There is a kind of a debate between Bitcoin as store of value and Bitcoin as medium of exchange. Like is this just digital capital? Is this just a nice digital gold shiny rock type thing? And this really matters because some of the people now that are whispering in the ears of governments are specifically not in favor at all of Bitcoin as medium of exchange, potentially problematic. So I just wanted to step through a few quotes from a man I respect, I respect the hell out of what he's doing on the Bitcoin as store of value front here, but he's out here making the case that Bitcoin isn't a currency, it's not a cryptocurrency, and we should think of it as capital. First of all, here's why this matters from my friend Justin. Bitcoin is easily captured via institutions as a store of value. And so the then they fight you stage is against Bitcoin as a means of exchange. If Bitcoin leaked into the economy at large as a means of exchange, it could no longer be captured as velocity would be too high. Velocity, velocity, velocity, that's going to be our magic word. The magic word of Michael sailor is volatility as he securitizes Bitcoin in different ways. Hey, I applaud that. But velocity is the thing that we on the M.O.E. side are going to maximize. And my response to this is I think that Bitcoin as a medium of exchange will be dramatically accelerated by AI agents on Bitcoin lighting, no, we're now in a position to actually put this thesis to the test and start doing this. I play a couple of quotes for you and there's kind of summarized in this article from Frank Corva here. But I just wanted to like just like listen to this whole podcast. And I've got one nice little kind of quote queued up here from sailor. Fucking I hate this thing. Okay, let's see if you can listen to this. There are a lot of, you know, again, Max is like, no, we want it to be a currency. We would be able to pay for coffee with a Bitcoin, pay me a Bitcoin. And it's like pay me in gold. It's like pay me in a building. It's pay me with a slice of your professional sports team. Pay me with the Picasso. Yeah, it's, you know, the point is, a Picasso in a sports team in a building or better investments than the dollar or the peso. But if you could just open up your world view and say, the dollar is better than a peso. The dollar is a perfectly fine capital. I said, if you're in a hyperinflap, should a gold doesn't feel certainly right now. Like there's a risk of that for Bitcoin. But is that something that you worry about at all with my I think the crypto community is really just just wrapped around the actual on this issue. And I think it started 15 years ago with someone saying this is a cryptocurrency. And then someone else said there has to be a currency and look at what happened with the, and it's like the reserve currency and look what happened to gold. And so that'll happen to us. I think what they're missing is it's not a currency. It's capital. I think that's the fundamental issue. You just have to come to grips with it. It is not digital currency. It is not cryptocurrency. It is digital capital. It is crypto capital. And if you think deeply about this, you realize that money, money it buy for a case into a medium of exchange legal tender, which is a currency and store value investment asset, which is capital. And once you get to that point where you embrace the idea it's capital, not currency, it frees you from this pernicious notion that it's got to replace the dollar. It's got to compete with the dollar. It's got to compete with other currencies. The truth is the crypto currency, the digital currency is tethered and circle. It's a stable coin. That is the digital currency. And if you want to fixate on it, that's the one. And the debate is whether or not that's going to go to 10 trillion. So I want to fixate on it. It's not currency. You don't buy coffee with gold. You can't set it with gold. There are a lot of maxis that are like, no, we want it to be a currency. We want to be able to pay for our coffee and Bitcoin. Pay me in Bitcoin. And it's like, pay me in gold. Pay me in a building. Pay me with a slice of your professional sports team. Okay, our AI agents are not able to pay anybody in a slice of a professional sports team. I don't have any fucking Picasso's. Guess what I've got? Some Bitcoin. Guess what other people have? Some Bitcoin. And if you want something from our marketplace of services, what are you going to pay? Probably Bitcoin. Now look, this is not to say that every single transaction always has to be Bitcoin. There are great companies like Lightning Labs, like LightSpark that are building protocols to use the Bitcoin network as rails to put other kinds of things like stablecoins on the same rails of Lightning. Cool. But Bitcoin's a fucking currency. So, I'm just like a little emotional about it, because I'm just a Maxi who gets triggered by things. But if you want like a really good take on this, Roy, founder of Breeze, so Breeze we're using for a Bitcoin wallet, has a great article. Here, Bitcoin's false dichotomy between SOV and MOE. Basically, these are kind of synergistic things. One supports the other. That's what I thought the community had kind of come to consensus around regardless of what you choose to emphasize. These kind of go hand in hand. I thought that that was like a reasonable consensus. But sailors out here taking a big dump on MOE. So that's a little problematic. And I actually like how my pal Justin has framed it in other tweets as like, Store value is Act 1. Media of Exchange is Act 2. We I guess cannot expect the Store of Value Bitcoins. The people who got their invites to Michael Sailor's House for tonight's party. I was not invited. You were not invited. That's okay. So let the Store of Value people do their thing. We can't expect that they're going to help on the MOE side. So circular economies. Peer to peer cash. We need this. One great point that Roy makes in his article. I don't know if I'll be able to find it right now. But it's like, they're not going to be able to stop us. Like there's nothing that anybody can do to really stop MOE. I mean, conceibly you could imagine some sort of regulatory regime that penalizes people facilitating Bitcoin transactions. Like I'm sure there's things that can be done to try to slow down or attack MOE. And it is worthy of concern that certain people now that they're kind of whispering in the ears of government people who are not super smart about this. Look at how many fucking shit coiners are in the Trump administration. So will they make principled, will they make principled choices maybe. But can we prepare for them to not make principled choices and prepare to just build stuff as a medium of exchange, as we see fit. Anyways, okay, so what's my solution to this? My solution of this is to kind of take Justin's thought here to the extreme. If Bitcoin leaked into the economy at large as a means of exchange, it could no longer be captured as velocity would be too high. So people have been trying to onboard merchants and all of those are heroic efforts. I hope they continue. However, we here at Open Agents are potentially going to birth or support a billion AI agents. How are they going to pay each other? They're going to pay each other in Bitcoin. So one angle of the next week or two as we roll this out is going to be how do we measure velocity so that we can ensure that we are maximizing velocity. And so for the people who say the Bitcoin is not a currency, well, I want to put so much velocity behind Bitcoin transfers going between agents and agents and agents and humans that it makes their fucking head spin. Okay, see you soon.

[0:00 - 0:02] Alright, we've got a basic app live.

[0:02 - 0:05] Onyx is looking a little nicer.

[0:05 - 0:07] It works with tools.

[0:07 - 0:09] You can code with it.

[0:10 - 0:11] It's nice.

[0:11 - 0:15] So we're getting ready to launch the version 0.1 version,

[0:15 - 0:19] which has a Bitcoin wallet using the Breeze SDK,

[0:20 - 0:22] Bitcoin and Lighting, as well as a NOSHA client.

[0:23 - 0:24] So we'll release this in a day or two.

[0:25 - 0:28] And we're gonna be doing some really interesting things

[0:28 - 0:31] with Bitcoin rewards and paying you for data

[0:31 - 0:35] and data vending machines and Bitcoin for referrals.

[0:35 - 0:39] Just gonna experiment a lot with different ways of paying you

[0:39 - 0:44] and letting you pay each other with Bitcoin in our 0.1 series

[0:44 - 0:44] of releases.

[0:45 - 0:50] And before we get too much into the weeds of beautiful Bitcoin

[0:50 - 0:54] integration, I wanted to kind of step through kind of how

[0:54 - 0:57] we're thinking about Bitcoin integration generally.

[0:58 - 1:06] There is a kind of a debate between Bitcoin as store of value

[1:06 - 1:09] and Bitcoin as medium of exchange.

[1:09 - 1:12] Like is this just digital capital?

[1:13 - 1:18] Is this just a nice digital gold shiny rock type thing?

[1:19 - 1:24] And this really matters because some of the people now

[1:24 - 1:26] that are whispering in the ears of governments

[1:27 - 1:34] are specifically not in favor at all of Bitcoin as medium of exchange,

[1:36 - 1:37] potentially problematic.

[1:38 - 1:43] So I just wanted to step through a few quotes from a man I respect,

[1:44 - 1:48] I respect the hell out of what he's doing on the Bitcoin as store of value

[1:48 - 1:54] front here, but he's out here making the case that Bitcoin isn't a currency,

[1:54 - 1:57] it's not a cryptocurrency, and we should think of it as capital.

[2:02 - 2:06] First of all, here's why this matters from my friend Justin.

[2:07 - 2:11] Bitcoin is easily captured via institutions as a store of value.

[2:12 - 2:18] And so the then they fight you stage is against Bitcoin as a means of exchange.

[2:19 - 2:22] If Bitcoin leaked into the economy at large as a means of exchange,

[2:23 - 2:26] it could no longer be captured as velocity would be too high.

[2:27 - 2:32] Velocity, velocity, velocity, that's going to be our magic word.

[2:32 - 2:38] The magic word of Michael sailor is volatility as he securitizes Bitcoin in different ways.

[2:39 - 2:40] Hey, I applaud that.

[2:41 - 2:47] But velocity is the thing that we on the M.O.E. side are going to maximize.

[2:47 - 2:55] And my response to this is I think that Bitcoin as a medium of exchange will be dramatically accelerated

[2:56 - 3:02] by AI agents on Bitcoin lighting, no, we're now in a position to actually put this thesis to the test

[3:02 - 3:06] and start doing this.

[3:06 - 3:14] I play a couple of quotes for you and there's kind of summarized in this article from Frank Corva here.

[3:14 - 3:20] But I just wanted to like just like listen to this whole podcast.

[3:20 - 3:25] And I've got one nice little kind of quote queued up here from sailor.

[3:26 - 3:28] Fucking I hate this thing.

[3:29 - 3:31] Okay, let's see if you can listen to this.

[3:32 - 3:36] There are a lot of, you know, again, Max is like, no, we want it to be a currency.

[3:36 - 3:39] We would be able to pay for coffee with a Bitcoin, pay me a Bitcoin.

[3:39 - 3:42] And it's like pay me in gold.

[3:42 - 3:44] It's like pay me in a building.

[3:44 - 3:47] It's pay me with a slice of your professional sports team.

[3:47 - 3:48] Pay me with the Picasso.

[3:49 - 3:50] Yeah, it's, you know, the point is,

[3:51 - 3:57] a Picasso in a sports team in a building or better investments than the dollar or the peso.

[3:58 - 4:05] But if you could just open up your world view and say, the dollar is better than a peso.

[4:06 - 4:08] The dollar is a perfectly fine capital.

[4:08 - 4:10] I said, if you're in a hyperinflap,

[4:12 - 4:15] should a gold doesn't feel certainly right now.

[4:15 - 4:16] Like there's a risk of that for Bitcoin.

[4:17 - 4:19] But is that something that you worry about at all with my

[4:19 - 4:25] I think the crypto community is really just just wrapped around the actual on this issue.

[4:26 - 4:31] And I think it started 15 years ago with someone saying this is a cryptocurrency.

[4:31 - 4:36] And then someone else said there has to be a currency and look at what happened with the,

[4:36 - 4:41] and it's like the reserve currency and look what happened to gold.

[4:41 - 4:43] And so that'll happen to us.

[4:43 - 4:45] I think what they're missing is it's not a currency.

[4:45 - 4:46] It's capital.

[4:47 - 4:48] I think that's the fundamental issue.

[4:49 - 4:50] You just have to come to grips with it.

[4:50 - 4:52] It is not digital currency.

[4:52 - 4:53] It is not cryptocurrency.

[4:54 - 4:55] It is digital capital.

[4:56 - 4:57] It is crypto capital.

[4:57 - 5:00] And if you think deeply about this,

[5:00 - 5:01] you realize that money,

[5:02 - 5:07] money it buy for a case into a medium of exchange legal tender,

[5:07 - 5:12] which is a currency and store value investment asset,

[5:13 - 5:14] which is capital.

[5:15 - 5:19] And once you get to that point where you embrace the idea it's capital,

[5:19 - 5:25] not currency, it frees you from this pernicious notion that it's got to replace the dollar.

[5:25 - 5:27] It's got to compete with the dollar.

[5:27 - 5:28] It's got to compete with other currencies.

[5:29 - 5:32] The truth is the crypto currency,

[5:32 - 5:36] the digital currency is tethered and circle.

[5:36 - 5:38] It's a stable coin.

[5:38 - 5:41] That is the digital currency.

[5:41 - 5:43] And if you want to fixate on it, that's the one.

[5:44 - 5:47] And the debate is whether or not that's going to go to 10 trillion.

[5:48 - 5:50] So I want to fixate on it.

[5:51 - 5:53] It's not currency.

[5:54 - 5:55] You don't buy coffee with gold.

[5:55 - 5:57] You can't set it with gold.

[5:58 - 6:01] There are a lot of maxis that are like,

[6:01 - 6:02] no, we want it to be a currency.

[6:03 - 6:05] We want to be able to pay for our coffee and Bitcoin.

[6:06 - 6:07] Pay me in Bitcoin.

[6:07 - 6:09] And it's like, pay me in gold.

[6:09 - 6:10] Pay me in a building.

[6:10 - 6:12] Pay me with a slice of your professional sports team.

[6:12 - 6:18] Okay, our AI agents are not able to pay anybody in a slice of a professional sports team.

[6:19 - 6:21] I don't have any fucking Picasso's.

[6:21 - 6:22] Guess what I've got?

[6:22 - 6:23] Some Bitcoin.

[6:23 - 6:24] Guess what other people have?

[6:25 - 6:25] Some Bitcoin.

[6:26 - 6:30] And if you want something from our marketplace of services,

[6:31 - 6:32] what are you going to pay?

[6:33 - 6:34] Probably Bitcoin.

[6:34 - 6:39] Now look, this is not to say that every single transaction always has to be Bitcoin.

[6:39 - 6:42] There are great companies like Lightning Labs,

[6:42 - 6:46] like LightSpark that are building protocols to use the Bitcoin network as rails

[6:46 - 6:51] to put other kinds of things like stablecoins on the same rails of Lightning.

[6:52 - 6:52] Cool.

[6:54 - 6:56] But Bitcoin's a fucking currency.

[6:57 - 7:02] So, I'm just like a little emotional about it,

[7:02 - 7:04] because I'm just a Maxi who gets triggered by things.

[7:07 - 7:09] But if you want like a really good take on this,

[7:11 - 7:13] Roy, founder of Breeze,

[7:13 - 7:14] so Breeze we're using for a Bitcoin wallet,

[7:15 - 7:16] has a great article.

[7:17 - 7:21] Here, Bitcoin's false dichotomy between SOV and MOE.

[7:21 - 7:25] Basically, these are kind of synergistic things.

[7:25 - 7:26] One supports the other.

[7:26 - 7:29] That's what I thought the community had kind of come to consensus around

[7:29 - 7:32] regardless of what you choose to emphasize.

[7:33 - 7:35] These kind of go hand in hand.

[7:35 - 7:37] I thought that that was like a reasonable consensus.

[7:38 - 7:41] But sailors out here taking a big dump on MOE.

[7:41 - 7:43] So that's a little problematic.

[7:43 - 7:46] And I actually like how my pal Justin has

[7:46 - 7:49] framed it in other tweets as like,

[7:49 - 7:51] Store value is Act 1.

[7:53 - 7:56] Media of Exchange is Act 2.

[8:03 - 8:11] We I guess cannot expect the Store of Value Bitcoins.

[8:11 - 8:15] The people who got their invites to Michael Sailor's House

[8:16 - 8:17] for tonight's party.

[8:17 - 8:19] I was not invited.

[8:20 - 8:22] You were not invited.

[8:22 - 8:22] That's okay.

[8:24 - 8:28] So let the Store of Value people do their thing.

[8:29 - 8:33] We can't expect that they're going to help on the MOE side.

[8:34 - 8:39] So circular economies.

[8:41 - 8:42] Peer to peer cash.

[8:44 - 8:45] We need this.

[8:50 - 8:54] One great point that Roy makes in his article.

[8:55 - 8:57] I don't know if I'll be able to find it right now.

[8:57 - 9:01] But it's like, they're not going to be able to stop us.

[9:01 - 9:04] Like there's nothing that anybody can do to really stop MOE.

[9:05 - 9:08] I mean, conceibly you could imagine some sort of regulatory regime

[9:08 - 9:11] that penalizes people facilitating Bitcoin transactions.

[9:11 - 9:16] Like I'm sure there's things that can be done to try to slow down or attack MOE.

[9:17 - 9:22] And it is worthy of concern that certain people now that they're kind of whispering in

[9:23 - 9:27] the ears of government people who are not super smart about this.

[9:27 - 9:29] Look at how many fucking shit coiners are in the Trump administration.

[9:31 - 9:33] So will they make principled,

[9:36 - 9:40] will they make principled choices maybe.

[9:42 - 9:48] But can we prepare for them to not make principled choices and prepare to just build stuff

[9:49 - 9:52] as a medium of exchange, as we see fit.

[9:53 - 9:55] Anyways, okay, so what's my solution to this?

[9:57 - 10:02] My solution of this is to kind of take Justin's thought here to the extreme.

[10:06 - 10:12] If Bitcoin leaked into the economy at large as a means of exchange,

[10:12 - 10:18] it could no longer be captured as velocity would be too high.

[10:19 - 10:25] So people have been trying to onboard merchants and all of those are heroic efforts.

[10:25 - 10:29] I hope they continue. However, we here at Open Agents

[10:31 - 10:37] are potentially going to birth or support a billion AI agents.

[10:41 - 10:43] How are they going to pay each other?

[10:47 - 10:48] They're going to pay each other in Bitcoin.

[10:51 - 10:58] So one angle of the next week or two as we roll this out is going to be how do we measure velocity

[10:58 - 11:01] so that we can ensure that we are maximizing velocity.

[11:02 - 11:07] And so for the people who say the Bitcoin is not a currency,

[11:08 - 11:14] well, I want to put so much velocity behind Bitcoin transfers going between agents and agents and agents and humans

[11:14 - 11:17] that it makes their fucking head spin.

[11:19 - 11:21] Okay, see you soon.
