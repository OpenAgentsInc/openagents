## Full Transcript

Good morning. Wanted to share with you the results of our first ever agent that ran overnight. Came up with some interesting stuff. Just thinking about what's possible with the CloudFlare agent's SDK. Oh, it's still going. So I just want to show you kind of what I did here. So the idea here is we want to take the agentic chat here that works really well for my day-to-day development. You can kind of see an example. I just tweeted yesterday of what's possible with this where we're combining deep-seek R1 and sign a 35 to think deeply about things and then come up with code and just coming up with code that I just never would have come up with on my own. But to just start minimizing my involvement even in this, so that instead of needing to sit at the chat UI, I want agents doing this kind of thing overnight. Give it a feature request before I go to bed or a three feature request or ten feature request or have an agent give a feature request and then wake up in the morning and wake up to a bunch of PRs. That's the goal. So we're using the new CloudFlare agent SDK, which is really good. And I just want to show you kind of what I did here and redo the final results because it's pretty entertaining. So I just started by saying I kind of hacked it to add the tool support, the same thing we have in our current open agent interface. So I said on our current repo, read the readme and the docs. So I just had the readme be a summary of the CloudFlare agent SDK, core components features usage, and then the most recent work log times your fixes get up to and the stuff that's enabling this, the stuff that I added to the CloudFlare agent starter. And if those are doing I'm using the agent starter. Yeah, it's mostly just this plus to use. And then I gave it the tool to be able to think. So view file view folder. And then it's got the scheduling stuff that I started with and then think tool. I'm basically just, yeah, I'm just saying you're thinking assistant focus on deep analysis and reasoning. Each time you're called, build upon and extend previous concepts rather than repeating the earlier observations, view each prompt as part of an evolving conversation where you should introduce new angles deeper insights or connections that weren't prepared before. When analyzing conversation history, notice emerging patterns, shifts of focus, or potential future directions. That's basically it. And then I am having deep seek R1 to be thinking. And open a 4 out handles the schedule. Okay, let's see what it's coming up with. So the most recent one that I pulled is probably one or two more since then, but a representative example. Oh, and then the read me of the project, which is, yeah, that's just the CloudFlare agents. So I said, now you think it's a little bit more flexible than above. It starts by just kind of reflecting the air detector, distribute active model, RBC, system, a ball. And then like, then I say, please schedule a job every 15 minutes. You call a think tool reflecting on the above with an eye toward exploring future directions for expansion. This is a glorified crime job. I mean, these are crime jobs, but it lives in their CloudFlare Durable object with persistent memory and database and this kind of thing. And so it'll be easy to spit up like a whole bunch of these for users like you. So if I go like halfway down and it's starting to think about bio hybrid agent systems integrating synthetic biological components, what the? I want to copy basis whole thing just to see how it evolved. But I just wanted to read you the one that came up with that I woke up to. Let's read it together. The scheduled reflection on integrating adaptive swarm intelligence for distributed problem solving and dynamic environments has been completed. Here are the insights and proposed strategies. One swarm intelligence architecture, core components, requirement decentralized coordination, implementation peer to peer agent discovery via Durable object handles and web socket pups up channels. Integration with the SDK. Extend agent based with swarm.joy topic and swarm.broadcast. Dynamic task allocation market based bidding protocol. Gossip sub for task distribution. Nice new swarm scheduler replacing Cron powered by token incentivized. Bitcoin incentivized agent participation collective decision making federated Byzantine agreement layered with the case stark proofs. Consensus tool requiring 51% swarm approval for critical actions, E to your replication. Adaptive learning embedded tiny ml models trained on swarm wide state changes. Store model weights and SQLite sync VHCRDTs via real for real time swarm knowledge area. Sounds cool. Sound doable I guess with that tech bio hybrid swarm enhancements digital pharomones. Last pharomone map extends agent tool. Inserting to pharomones. Swarm DNA constraints. CRISPR encoded replication limits using synthetic biology. Okay. What the fuck? Security governance swarm on. Nums? Nothing on my sleeve addresses for agent identities. Agent ID is Blake 3 public key. Hierarchical consensus leaf no consensus. Tount assignment shark consensus root consensus ethical plans. Adversarial test chaos monkey style tool to simulate Byzantine slash poison agents. Some of the stuff it'll be interested to see in the history. How these ideas evolved and the got what what the hell is this. But I am going to after this pass this to a new model and just ask it to kind of explain stuff better. Developer toolkit disaster response swarm auto scheduling. Quake response swarm. Min agents 50 resource allocation and colony consensus protocol fault tolerance constraints. Max energy use ethical priority human life historical preservation. Oh no. It's funny how agents have no confidence in their ability to ship code quickly. Oh yeah, 2025 23 or the queue. We're not going to do in quarters people. We're going to be doing. We're doing overnight code sessions. Release alpha swarm SDK with simulation sandbox. Support less than a thousand agents, at 10,000. Let's do that. That's like a project for a day. Innovate biofairman system in quantum safe identity. Launch autonomous swarm reorganization protocol. Synergy is across stack. Yeah, so I, you know, I may either. But comes to mind just like removing some little bio crisp, crisper stuff or go make friends with that junk. We hey guy. That makes a means spiking our networks process cluster sensor data. Interstellar governance lightweight FBFT consensus suitable for light year latency environments. Future challenges information overload implement diffusion LM based data summarization to compress claustrophotication. Dynamic openness balance permissionless claustrophotus patient zero to on energy, ethical imbalance, introduce satellite remote sensing for dynamic bonus allocation mechanism. Conclusion. This evolution transformed the chat agent starter kit into a distributed autonomous neural network capable of self organizing intelligence and disaster response interstellar resource coordination and more. Next steps could focus on developer tool chain implementation or deepening biochemical constraint modules. Let me know how you'd like to proceed. How should we proceed everybody? How will you proceed?

[0:00 - 0:01] Good morning.

[0:01 - 0:07] Wanted to share with you the results of our first ever agent that ran overnight.

[0:08 - 0:10] Came up with some interesting stuff.

[0:10 - 0:17] Just thinking about what's possible with the CloudFlare agent's SDK.

[0:19 - 0:23] Oh, it's still going.

[0:25 - 0:27] So I just want to show you kind of what I did here.

[0:28 - 0:39] So the idea here is we want to take the agentic chat here that works really well for my

[0:39 - 0:40] day-to-day development.

[0:41 - 0:43] You can kind of see an example.

[0:44 - 0:50] I just tweeted yesterday of what's possible with this where we're combining deep-seek

[0:50 - 0:55] R1 and sign a 35 to think deeply about things and then come up with code and just coming

[0:55 - 0:58] up with code that I just never would have come up with on my own.

[1:00 - 1:05] But to just start minimizing my involvement even in this, so that instead of needing

[1:05 - 1:08] to sit at the chat UI, I want agents doing this kind of thing overnight.

[1:11 - 1:16] Give it a feature request before I go to bed or a three feature request or ten feature

[1:16 - 1:21] request or have an agent give a feature request and then wake up in the morning and wake

[1:21 - 1:22] up to a bunch of PRs.

[1:22 - 1:22] That's the goal.

[1:25 - 1:28] So we're using the new CloudFlare agent SDK, which is really good.

[1:29 - 1:35] And I just want to show you kind of what I did here and redo the final results because

[1:35 - 1:36] it's pretty entertaining.

[1:37 - 1:42] So I just started by saying I kind of hacked it to add the tool support, the same thing

[1:42 - 1:44] we have in our current open agent interface.

[2:38 - 2:41] And then it's got the scheduling stuff that I started with and then think tool.

[2:44 - 2:49] I'm basically just, yeah, I'm just saying you're thinking assistant focus on deep analysis

[2:49 - 2:50] and reasoning.

[2:50 - 2:55] Each time you're called, build upon and extend previous concepts rather than repeating

[2:55 - 3:02] the earlier observations, view each prompt as part of an evolving conversation where you

[3:02 - 3:06] should introduce new angles deeper insights or connections that weren't prepared before.

[3:07 - 3:10] When analyzing conversation history, notice emerging patterns, shifts of focus, or potential

[3:10 - 3:11] future directions.

[3:17 - 3:18] That's basically it.

[3:19 - 3:23] And then I am having deep seek R1 to be thinking.
