## Full Transcript

Let's imagine the year is 2030 and you've got your personal fleet of AI agents. What is that going to look and feel like? Maybe it'll feel a little bit like Tony Stark, Commanding Jarvis, Beat Boot Bop, manipulating holograms, cool UIs. What is it not going to look like? It's not going to look like a fork of VS Code. Tony Stark does not use Microsoft products, so it wouldn't fork off from them. No, what's it going to look like? Less like VS Code, more like Starcraft. I like Kenneth. Good thinking. Who's building the Starcraft UI for managing AI agents? Huh, yeah. So six months ago, I said, yeah, we are. Then we had a little earlier version, have with some pains you can move around, started to feel a little futuristic. Greg says, God, the future of programming is so weird. Basically a bunch of random floating AR windows looking to get code patches and live environments for executing stuff with voice and neural outputs orchestrating multiple agents to perform tasks at higher and higher level of abstraction. Yeah. Plus the Starcraft hood and key bindings for groups of agents and cool macros. Yeah. Good analysis from DAX. Blah, blah, blah. Agents will soon get to the point where they are good enough that you can confidently manage multiple at a time or go fully afk and lay your agents where it should feel more like Starcraft where you're commanding multiple agents doing multiple things, hot keys swapping between agent groups, seeing highlights on a futuristic dashboard. So you see only the needed info to command your fleet without getting bogged down in details and debugging. Yes, we are building this power overwhelming. Okay. So we're going to resume our building in public series. We built basically the economic engine that's going to go into all of this called agent payments. This is going to let us discover actual market forces of what people are actually willing to pay for agents minus the subsidies of large VC companies, you know, spending hundreds of millions of dollars distorting price signals. We want to know what actual price signals are for agents in the Bitcoin eyes open protocol economy. I'll leave you with a quote for like one thing that's important about what we're doing here from Michael Saylor. The AIs are coming. The AIs don't get bank accounts. You don't get credit cards. The AIs artificial economy will be built on digital capital, digital property. It'll be a hundred trillion dollar economy. It will be built on Bitcoin on a steel and idea from Keon from Stacker News who talks about Bitcoin as a mechanism of coordination. Bitcoin, aka price like money, can help people find signal where otherwise there is noise. And in a world of 30 different agent frameworks and 30 different AI editors and a trimie coding agent, there's a whole bunch of noise, not a lot of signal. Signal will emerge from price in a market. So at the core of what we're building with open agents is a market, a marketplace. Go back to episode one of this series I did after Dev Day presentation in 2023. The core idea was always like an agent marketplace, open money, open protocols, open compute. We now have with the huge swell of interest in open protocols like model context protocol and now a two a from Google. A lot of people starting to speak the language of open protocols and interoperability. But there's still this missing mechanism called price price enables coordination at scale. We humans need to coordinate so we're not all building the same different agent abstractions over and over and over and able to take advantage of like the long tail. What is this effect? I'm going to end it there because look at this beautiful effect. All right, so we're building this. It's called commander. You should be able to spin up agents as easy as like hitting hotkeys, you know, click drag command and we're going to do a video every day this week and probably next week aiming to get something cool in your hands in about two weeks to actually command some agents in a futuristic sci-fi interface. See you soon.

[0:00 - 0:05] Let's imagine the year is 2030 and you've got your personal fleet of AI agents.

[0:05 - 0:07] What is that going to look and feel like?

[0:07 - 0:13] Maybe it'll feel a little bit like Tony Stark, Commanding Jarvis, Beat Boot Bop, manipulating

[0:13 - 0:15] holograms, cool UIs.

[0:16 - 0:17] What is it not going to look like?

[0:17 - 0:20] It's not going to look like a fork of VS Code.

[0:20 - 0:24] Tony Stark does not use Microsoft products, so it wouldn't fork off from them.

[0:25 - 0:26] No, what's it going to look like?

[0:27 - 0:30] Less like VS Code, more like Starcraft.

[0:33 - 0:33] I like Kenneth.

[0:34 - 0:34] Good thinking.

[0:35 - 0:38] Who's building the Starcraft UI for managing AI agents?

[0:38 - 0:39] Huh, yeah.

[0:40 - 0:41] So six months ago, I said, yeah, we are.

[0:42 - 0:45] Then we had a little earlier version, have with some pains you can move around, started

[0:45 - 0:46] to feel a little futuristic.

[0:49 - 0:52] Greg says, God, the future of programming is so weird.

[0:52 - 0:56] Basically a bunch of random floating AR windows looking to get code patches and live environments

[0:56 - 1:00] for executing stuff with voice and neural outputs orchestrating multiple agents to perform

[1:00 - 1:02] tasks at higher and higher level of abstraction.

[1:03 - 1:03] Yeah.

[1:04 - 1:07] Plus the Starcraft hood and key bindings for groups of agents and cool macros.

[1:07 - 1:07] Yeah.

[1:08 - 1:08] 

[1:10 - 1:12] Good analysis from DAX.

[1:12 - 1:12] Blah, blah, blah.

[1:15 - 1:19] Agents will soon get to the point where they are good enough that you can confidently

[1:19 - 1:23] manage multiple at a time or go fully afk and lay your agents where it should feel more

[1:23 - 1:27] like Starcraft where you're commanding multiple agents doing multiple things, hot keys swapping

[1:27 - 1:30] between agent groups, seeing highlights on a futuristic dashboard.

[1:30 - 1:35] So you see only the needed info to command your fleet without getting bogged down in details

[1:35 - 1:35] and debugging.

[1:36 - 1:39] Yes, we are building this power overwhelming.

[1:42 - 1:43] Okay.

[1:45 - 1:49] So we're going to resume our building in public series.

[1:49 - 1:53] We built basically the economic engine that's going to go into all of this called agent payments.

[1:54 - 1:58] This is going to let us discover actual market forces of what people are actually willing

[1:58 - 2:03] to pay for agents minus the subsidies of large VC companies, you know, spending hundreds

[2:03 - 2:05] of millions of dollars distorting price signals.

[2:05 - 2:11] We want to know what actual price signals are for agents in the Bitcoin eyes open protocol

[2:11 - 2:11] economy.

[2:13 - 2:17] I'll leave you with a quote for like one thing that's important about what we're doing

[2:17 - 2:19] here from Michael Saylor.

[2:20 - 2:21] The AIs are coming.

[2:21 - 2:23] The AIs don't get bank accounts.

[2:23 - 2:24] You don't get credit cards.

[2:24 - 2:28] The AIs artificial economy will be built on digital capital, digital property.

[2:29 - 2:31] It'll be a hundred trillion dollar economy.

[2:31 - 2:39] It will be built on Bitcoin on a steel and idea from Keon from Stacker News who talks about

[2:39 - 2:42] Bitcoin as a mechanism of coordination.

[2:43 - 2:52] Bitcoin, aka price like money, can help people find signal where otherwise there is noise.

[2:53 - 2:59] And in a world of 30 different agent frameworks and 30 different AI editors and a trimie coding

[2:59 - 3:02] agent, there's a whole bunch of noise, not a lot of signal.

[3:03 - 3:06] Signal will emerge from price in a market.

[3:06 - 3:11] So at the core of what we're building with open agents is a market, a marketplace.

[3:11 - 3:16] Go back to episode one of this series I did after Dev Day presentation in 2023.

[3:16 - 3:21] The core idea was always like an agent marketplace, open money, open protocols, open compute.

[3:22 - 3:27] We now have with the huge swell of interest in open protocols like model context protocol

[3:27 - 3:29] and now a two a from Google.

[3:29 - 3:33] A lot of people starting to speak the language of open protocols and interoperability.

[3:33 - 3:38] But there's still this missing mechanism called price price enables coordination at scale.

[3:38 - 3:44] We humans need to coordinate so we're not all building the same different agent abstractions

[3:44 - 3:48] over and over and over and able to take advantage of like the long tail.

[3:48 - 3:49] What is this effect?

[3:50 - 3:52] I'm going to end it there because look at this beautiful effect.

[3:52 - 3:53] All right, so we're building this.

[3:53 - 3:54] It's called commander.

[3:55 - 4:01] You should be able to spin up agents as easy as like hitting hotkeys, you know, click drag

[4:01 - 4:05] command and we're going to do a video every day this week and probably next week aiming

[4:05 - 4:11] to get something cool in your hands in about two weeks to actually command some agents

[4:11 - 4:12] in a futuristic sci-fi interface.

[4:12 - 4:13] See you soon.
