## Full Transcript

Hey are these agents with bitcalling balances? What happens if I select two of them and hit P to pay? Ignore the horrible UI here. Sending two sats to scout 4194, let's see if it actually happens. What's taken so long? There we go. And you'll notice that if I refresh this page, value transaction 30 sats, number of payments 16, spark payments, these are spark payments. And boom, two sats up. And you know how we've been saying that creating agents to be super easy? What if I just hit the button A for 14 agent agencies? A agents scout created. How many are there now? Oh 15. That was really easy. And then how did I fund this? Well, if I make another one and I do a payment between these two, hang on, I messed up the selection thing. But if I do pee and they don't have wallets yet, it should pop me up an invoice, which my phone is what I'm using for a camera. But anyway, I did that for those first ones and that worked. So this is connected to our agent payments API, visualizing it in a cool way. So we're kind of doing this first for commander because we want the economic engine to be spinning like we want this to be sort of based around this idea of payments that are super easy and fun and cool to look at. So what's next? See you soon.
