## Full Transcript

Let's make things interesting shall we built a little sink engine here Kind of addressing a problem from the last video. We were kind of doing these basic HTTP requests to update the UI there Kind of brittle won't work for multiplayer. Obviously we want multiple people being able to see these agent Landscapes canvases at once So whipped up a little sink engine using electric sequel, which is amazing paired with effect TypeScript fame work Yeah, so now we have basically this sink engine wrapping up postgres database. So when we make changes in the postgres database It'll Update it for all connected clients. I got two different browsers here And then I could do some other cool things like if I update randomly the position and rotation of Some subset of these they'll kind of animate You know did this in a 3d environment. I don't know that we want to do 3d the 2d Thing kind of maybe makes more sense to start with Maybe we do like a 2.5d where you're kind of like hovering over the landscape So I still don't know kind of what exactly in the short term I want this to feel like should it be like a Canvas should it be Starcraft should it be factorial kind of hovering over top, but they're still like models Anyways, whatever we do we will have a awesome sync of Global state to any connected users which we could subset by you know team you get to see your team Agents update instantly Or maybe some global agents collaborative ones. I don't know. I don't know. I think we can do this any ideas Let us know see. Yeah

[0:00 - 0:03] Let's make things interesting shall we built a little sink engine here

[0:04 - 0:11] Kind of addressing a problem from the last video. We were kind of doing these basic HTTP requests

[0:12 - 0:13] to update the

[0:14 - 0:15] UI there

[0:15 - 0:21] Kind of brittle won't work for multiplayer. Obviously we want multiple people being able to see these

[0:21 - 0:22] agent

[0:23 - 0:25] Landscapes canvases at once

[0:25 - 0:30] So whipped up a little sink engine using electric sequel, which is amazing

[0:31 - 0:33] paired with effect TypeScript fame work

[0:34 - 0:38] Yeah, so now we have basically this

[0:38 - 0:43] sink engine wrapping up postgres database. So when we make changes in the postgres database

[0:43 - 0:44] It'll

[0:44 - 0:48] Update it for all connected clients. I got two different browsers here

[0:48 - 0:54] And then I could do some other cool things like if I update randomly the position and rotation of

[0:54 - 0:57] Some subset of these they'll kind of animate

[0:58 - 1:02] You know did this in a 3d environment. I don't know that we want to do 3d

[1:03 - 1:04] the 2d

[1:05 - 1:08] Thing kind of maybe makes more sense to start with

[1:09 - 1:13] Maybe we do like a 2.5d where you're kind of like hovering over the landscape

[1:15 - 1:22] So I still don't know kind of what exactly in the short term I want this to feel like should it be like a

[1:22 - 1:25] Canvas should it be

[1:26 - 1:32] Starcraft should it be factorial kind of hovering over top, but they're still like models

[1:33 - 1:36] Anyways, whatever we do we will have a

[1:37 - 1:39] awesome sync of

[1:39 - 1:46] Global state to any connected users which we could subset by you know team you get to see your team

[1:48 - 1:50] Agents update instantly

[1:51 - 1:56] Or maybe some global agents collaborative ones. I don't know. I don't know. I think we can do this any ideas

[1:57 - 1:58] Let us know see. Yeah
