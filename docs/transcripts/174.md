## Full Transcript

Folks, I'm excited to announce that this month we are rebooting our Swarm Compute Network, previously called GPUTOPIA, now called OpenAgence Compute. Why should you care? Because you can sell your spare compute for Bitcoin, as simple as running a simple desktop app, adding your computer to our global compute marketplace and getting paid. Bitcoin. This is something we've already launched. It worked. We paid out, I don't know how many tens or hundreds of compute providers. You could provide your compute first through a web application, then through a worker-be software that supported inference, fine-tuning, embedding, image generation, all through an open AI compatible endpoint. We phased this out. Part of this was, we had a bunch of sellers, not enough buyers. Now this was 18 months ago. We thought that in the future, the ideal buyer that's going to really help launch this as a two-sided marketplace are going to be agents. Once agents are good and easy enough to use, that should solve that demand issue. Okay, 18 months later, a pivot to OpenAgence later, 170 videos of building a whole bunch of agents infrastructure later. We're ready to bring this back in. So much has changed in the last 18 months. We've got great ways of running local models so that we don't need to be building, what is this? We don't need to be building this infrastructure anymore. We can just pay people for running things like old model, focusing on what we're good at. Okay, so the thing that we're going to be uniquely providing to this is the super cool interface. You're going to install an app. It's going to be a way for you to see the earnings and visualize the network activity paired with a cool game style sci-fi hood for actually using these agents. It's going to feel a little bit like a video game, but it's going to have agent payments tied directly into it. Okay, so we are going to be kind of building and beta testing this over the next week or so. In our discord, our objective is to take all this kind of stuff that we've built so far and put it into one open source software package. We're going to continue doing the whole build in public thing. We're going to be beta testing things still in our discord. That's been going great. We want to get the first payments out to sellers of compute a week from today at the latest. If you want to get a start on that, we're going to be using Olamma as our local model provider. You'll need an Olamma installed locally, go install Olamma, and then obviously you'll have through open agents the wallet, which works just fine as you can see in our previous video. Stay tuned!

[0:04 - 0:09] Compute Network, previously called GPUTOPIA, now called OpenAgence Compute.

[0:10 - 0:16] Why should you care? Because you can sell your spare compute for Bitcoin, as simple

[0:16 - 0:20] as running a simple desktop app, adding your computer to our global compute

[0:20 - 0:25] marketplace and getting paid. Bitcoin. This is something we've already launched.

[0:25 - 0:30] It worked. We paid out, I don't know how many tens or hundreds of compute providers.

[0:31 - 0:37] You could provide your compute first through a web application, then through a

[0:37 - 0:41] worker-be software that supported inference, fine-tuning, embedding, image

[0:41 - 0:47] generation, all through an open AI compatible endpoint. We phased this out.

[0:48 - 0:52] Part of this was, we had a bunch of sellers, not enough buyers. Now this was 18

[0:52 - 0:58] months ago. We thought that in the future, the ideal buyer that's going to really

[0:58 - 1:04] help launch this as a two-sided marketplace are going to be agents. Once agents

[1:04 - 1:09] are good and easy enough to use, that should solve that demand issue. Okay, 18

[1:09 - 1:18] months later, a pivot to OpenAgence later, 170 videos of building a whole bunch of

[1:18 - 1:25] agents infrastructure later. We're ready to bring this back in. So much has changed

[1:25 - 1:32] in the last 18 months. We've got great ways of running local models so that we don't

[1:32 - 1:36] need to be building, what is this? We don't need to be building this infrastructure anymore.

[1:36 - 1:42] We can just pay people for running things like old model, focusing on what we're good at.

[1:42 - 1:50] Okay, so the thing that we're going to be uniquely providing to this is the super cool

[1:50 - 1:55] interface. You're going to install an app. It's going to be a way for you to see the earnings

[1:55 - 2:03] and visualize the network activity paired with a cool game style sci-fi hood for actually

[2:03 - 2:08] using these agents. It's going to feel a little bit like a video game, but it's going to have

[2:08 - 2:15] agent payments tied directly into it. Okay, so we are going to be kind of building and beta testing

[2:15 - 2:23] this over the next week or so. In our discord, our objective is to take all this kind of stuff

[2:23 - 2:28] that we've built so far and put it into one open source software package. We're going to continue

[2:28 - 2:35] doing the whole build in public thing. We're going to be beta testing things still in our discord.
