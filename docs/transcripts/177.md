## Full Transcript

Oh, hello again. Commander V003 is now a Noster client. We have here a chat channel window that is using the Noster Nip28 spec written lead author by yours truly a couple years ago. So this is using an open decentralized network of relays, blah, blah, blah, and we can chat and um yeah. So I envision this initially as being powering like a decentralized telegram, but we're more exciting to have it power like a decentralized agent basically MMO with region and shouting in different chat between humans and agents. If you hit plus you should be able to create a new chat channel right now. You'd call this like the worst chat app ever like the don't have titles of chats or whatever. But if you see on the right I've got kind of this stream of Noster events, um creating channels and stuff and you know not fully a perfect implementation yet. But the cool thing is that if you are anyone anywhere in the world you can connect to these same Noster relays where you're just using some of the most popular ones and you can read and write to these chatchails. So we're going to be using this for our agent chat. And let me know what you think about the uh, and gestures combined with Noster. Alright we're getting close to implementing the full Noster based compute marketplace. Uh more on that tomorrow. See you soon.

[0:01 - 0:03] Oh, hello again.

[0:03 - 0:07] Commander V003 is now a Noster client.

[0:07 - 0:16] We have here a chat channel window that is using the Noster Nip28 spec written lead author

[0:16 - 0:17] by yours truly a couple years ago.

[0:18 - 0:23] So this is using an open decentralized network of relays, blah, blah, blah, and we can chat

[0:23 - 0:25] and um yeah.

[0:25 - 0:31] So I envision this initially as being powering like a decentralized telegram, but we're

[0:31 - 0:37] more exciting to have it power like a decentralized agent basically MMO with region and shouting

[0:37 - 0:41] in different chat between humans and agents.

[0:41 - 0:45] If you hit plus you should be able to create a new chat channel right now.

[0:45 - 0:49] You'd call this like the worst chat app ever like the don't have titles of chats or whatever.

[0:49 - 0:56] But if you see on the right I've got kind of this stream of Noster events, um creating channels

[0:56 - 1:00] and stuff and you know not fully a perfect implementation yet.

[1:01 - 1:05] But the cool thing is that if you are anyone anywhere in the world you can connect to these

[1:05 - 1:10] same Noster relays where you're just using some of the most popular ones and you can read

[1:10 - 1:12] and write to these chatchails.

[1:13 - 1:15] So we're going to be using this for our agent chat.

[1:16 - 1:23] And let me know what you think about the uh, and gestures combined with Noster.

[1:23 - 1:30] Alright we're getting close to implementing the full Noster based compute marketplace.

[1:31 - 1:33] Uh more on that tomorrow.

[1:34 - 1:34] See you soon.
