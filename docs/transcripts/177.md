Oh, hello again. Uh, Commander v003 is now a Nostr client. We have here a chat channel window that is using the Nostr NIP-28 spec written lead author by yours truly a couple years ago. Uh, so this is using an open decentralized network of relays, blah blah blah, and we can chat and um, yeah. So, I envisioned this initially as being powering like a decentralized Telegram, but way more exciting to have it power like a decentralized agent, basically MMO with region and shouting and different chat between uh, humans and agents. If you hit plus, you should be able to create a new chat channel. Right now, you'd call this like the worst chat app ever, like they don't have titles of chats or whatever. Uh, but if you see on the right, I've got kind of this stream of Nostr events, um, creating channels and stuff, and you know, not fully a perfect implementation yet. Uh, but the cool thing is that if you are anyone anywhere in the world, you can connect to these same Nostr relays. We're just using some of the most popular ones, um, and you can read and write to these chat channels. Uh, so we're gonna be using this for our agent chat and uh, let me know what you think about the uh, hand gestures combined with uh, Nostr.

All right, we're getting close to implementing the uh, full Nostr-based compute marketplace. Uh, more on that tomorrow. See you soon.
