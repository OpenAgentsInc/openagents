## Full Transcript

Hello again, I'm excited to demonstrate for you the first working production live example of the open agents compute network working in practice. We've got this beautiful button here called go online. We want you to be able to sell your compute for Bitcoin doing nothing but clicking this button and going online and earning Bitcoin. You'll notice that my wallet balance appears 464 Bitcoin sets. That corresponds to my provider wallet over here where I'm actually earning that's backwards maybe but that says 36 started with 536 sets have been paid three messages at a time from my MacBook computer where I'm currently recording this to my Linux desktop where I run larger models that don't run on my MacBook. Right now I'm just basically paying myself free sats but you can envision that there'll be people all around the world maybe someone's figured out how to run the full deep seek R1 in a local way and they just want to charge Bitcoin satch for that and you have access to this entire global marketplace of swarm inference. Eventually there will be swarm other kinds of things as well but let's demonstrate it so I'll right now click the big beautiful go online button over here. That makes me available to receive jobs. These are nip 90 jobs over an Oscar more on that separately but this is not a protocol that we're inventing it is a open protocol that works. Let's open up chat window you're not all doing a command for to open up windows moving in the direction of starcraft UI people. First let's demonstrate Olam so I want to just say hi there. This is running my local model so what model are you? This is Gemma 1b I want to an airplane I'll use Gemma 1b or other Gemma models locally but I want to be able to run more powerful models like Devstrel this is the new coding agent model apparently super good for agentic stuff from mistral 24 billion parameters I tried using it on my Mac it doesn't work and so let's try this I'm going to say now I changed you tell me now what model and lab. Are you from this is going out to the nostril it I'm connected to which my desktop app is also listening to the reason right now this will take like maybe a couple seconds otherwise that you like slower than you might otherwise want is because it's it's doing lightning invoice payments is doing lightning invoice payments which are pretty good for you. It could be faster so this will just get better and better but this works globally you'll see that I have 461 sats here and I have 39 sats here so it worked you know this is still alpha quality we've got to clean it up and add some more you know shiny little UI features that make it nicer but we're going to start testing this out. And let's build a global compute marketplace with inference and all these things fully decentralized using Bitcoin see you soon.

[0:00 - 0:12] Hello again, I'm excited to demonstrate for you the first working production live example of the open agents compute network working in practice. We've got this beautiful button here called go online.

[0:12 - 0:26] We want you to be able to sell your compute for Bitcoin doing nothing but clicking this button and going online and earning Bitcoin. You'll notice that my wallet balance appears 464 Bitcoin sets.

[0:26 - 0:48] That corresponds to my provider wallet over here where I'm actually earning that's backwards maybe but that says 36 started with 536 sets have been paid three messages at a time from my MacBook computer where I'm currently recording this to my Linux desktop where I run larger models that don't run on my MacBook.

[0:48 - 1:07] Right now I'm just basically paying myself free sats but you can envision that there'll be people all around the world maybe someone's figured out how to run the full deep seek R1 in a local way and they just want to charge Bitcoin satch for that and you have access to this entire global marketplace of swarm inference.

[1:07 - 1:30] Eventually there will be swarm other kinds of things as well but let's demonstrate it so I'll right now click the big beautiful go online button over here. That makes me available to receive jobs. These are nip 90 jobs over an Oscar more on that separately but this is not a protocol that we're inventing it is a open protocol that works.

[1:30 - 1:40] Let's open up chat window you're not all doing a command for to open up windows moving in the direction of starcraft UI people.

[1:40 - 1:50] First let's demonstrate Olam so I want to just say hi there. This is running my local model so what model are you?

[1:51 - 2:20] This is Gemma 1b I want to an airplane I'll use Gemma 1b or other Gemma models locally but I want to be able to run more powerful models like Devstrel this is the new coding agent model apparently super good for agentic stuff from mistral 24 billion parameters I tried using it on my Mac it doesn't work and so let's try this I'm going to say now I changed you tell me now what model and lab.

[2:20 - 2:50] Are you from this is going out to the nostril it I'm connected to which my desktop app is also listening to the reason right now this will take like maybe a couple seconds otherwise that you like slower than you might otherwise want is because it's it's doing lightning invoice payments is doing lightning invoice payments which are pretty good for you.

[2:51 - 3:19] It could be faster so this will just get better and better but this works globally you'll see that I have 461 sats here and I have 39 sats here so it worked you know this is still alpha quality we've got to clean it up and add some more you know shiny little UI features that make it nicer but we're going to start testing this out.

[3:19 - 3:29] And let's build a global compute marketplace with inference and all these things fully decentralized using Bitcoin see you soon.
