## Full Transcript

Hello again, you're looking at four different Claude code windows where I've been doing the most recent feature development of Commander. I have now switched my day-to-day workflow over from the raw Claude code terminal UI to Commander here. So each of these are the three different types of code. So let's try showing you a new thing. If I do command click on new chat, I get a new chat in a new window. And what should I do? Introduce yourself. So this uses pretty much everything that the Claude code terminal UI does. There's still a few things I don't have maybe fully represented. I don't know if the slash commands work or whatever. But this is working great for my purposes. And you can both watch multiple Claude codes working at the same time, as well as have access to history. I don't think Claude lets you do this at all, but I can load any of my previous chats and continue them. So my goal here is to get all of you fine people that are using Claude code working out of our interface instead of theirs. Because we're going to start doing cool things on top of this. Number one, just giving you your Tony Stark kind of Jarvis style interactions, hand gestures and soon voice. But then also pulling back in the stuff that we showed off in the last video about the extensible plugins using a Swarm Compute network. Basically, Claude code is the best coding agent right now. But we want to supplement that with pulling in tools, prompts and resources from a broad network of decentralized plugins and people running MCP servers. See you soon.

[0:00 - 0:03] Hello again, you're looking at four different

[0:03 - 0:10] Claude code windows where I've been doing the most recent

[0:10 - 0:14] feature development of Commander. I have now switched my

[0:14 - 0:19] day-to-day workflow over from the raw Claude code

[0:19 - 0:24] terminal UI to Commander here. So each of these are

[0:25 - 0:26] the three different types of code. So let's try

[0:28 - 0:34] showing you a new thing. If I do command click on new chat, I get a new chat in a new window.

[0:35 - 0:40] And what should I do? Introduce yourself. So this uses pretty much

[0:40 - 0:44] everything that the Claude code terminal UI does. There's still a few things I don't have

[0:45 - 0:48] maybe fully represented. I don't know if the slash commands work or whatever.

[0:48 - 0:53] But this is working great for my purposes. And you can

[0:53 - 0:58] both watch multiple Claude codes working at the same time,

[0:59 - 1:03] as well as have access to history. I don't think Claude

[1:03 - 1:06] lets you do this at all, but I can load any of my previous chats

[1:07 - 1:13] and continue them. So my goal here is to get all of you

[1:13 - 1:17] fine people that are using Claude code working out of our

[1:17 - 1:21] interface instead of theirs. Because we're going to start doing cool things on top of this.

[1:21 - 1:25] Number one, just giving you your Tony Stark kind of Jarvis style interactions,

[1:26 - 1:31] hand gestures and soon voice. But then also pulling back in the stuff that we showed

[1:31 - 1:33] off in the last video about the

[1:35 - 1:40] extensible plugins using a Swarm Compute network. Basically, Claude code is the best

[1:40 - 1:44] coding agent right now. But we want to supplement that with pulling in

[1:44 - 1:48] tools, prompts and resources from a broad network of

[1:48 - 1:52] decentralized plugins and people running MCP servers.

[1:54 - 1:55] See you soon.
