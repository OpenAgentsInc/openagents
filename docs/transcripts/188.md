If you're a power user of cloud code like me you may have seen this horrible scrolling in the T UI Terminal UI and you know, I don't know why everyone's building T. U. I's Clawed code was one and then everyone's copying off of them like can we just get a regular interface please? Okay, so I have finally broken my dependence on that horrible situation replacing it with the Gorgeous new open agents dashboard. This is a web application We're gonna go back to the desktop mobile thing. It's gonna be desktop web and mobile But for speed of iteration it was definitely fast or to pull everything into this Glorious web application which I'm using for business stuff separately, and I was just like let's just throw it all into here Okay, so what I have here is my whole cloud code workflow in a Web app, okay, so let me just kind of step through and show you my actual workflow and just let's let's do a PR together So my full workflow is I'll go over here and if I notice something oops, let's get that out of here If I notice something horrible like over here a session info There's just like too much like stuff over here. This a lot of you should be consolidated or put behind like eye things So go over here, and I'll say using my aqua voice. I hope it works with my recording going I'll say Consolidate a bunch of the app sidebar stuff. It is is that working? Yeah, consolidated a bunch of the app sidebar stuff. We don't need all those pains or Some should be combined and some of that information like configured to bugs just be put into like a little i bar Dialogue stuff hidden. There's just too much stuff there. Also, I want them to be collapsible Using the collapsible chat UI component install that if you need to Yeah, okay, so I use aqua voice. We're just like a little widget that lets you throw voice into whatever I'm not even gonna edit this. I'm just gonna say You know consolidate Session sidebar All right, so we've got issue 85 when the pop-up over to here. I'm gonna do new session I'm gonna say do issue 85 on a new work tree and Push an open PR and then I'll just go get a soda or whatever or to be fancy Why don't I go pick out a second issue right now? I've got it configured to do up to three sessions at a time I just got to play around with like what the actual rate limits are but it can theoretically handle multiple of those any other issues I want to do here I'll do a hard one this requires pulling in an external component Let's try that same thing do issue 45 Oops do issue 45 on a new work tree and push and open PR Okay, so this has been my workflow. I'll just queue up like two or three of these and then I'll come back to some PRs I've got a pre-push check running a hook running to do like lens and stuff But this is just calling my Cloud code here. I've got my little task progress bar Can inspect tools Some of the stuff is just like nicer to have actual collapsible shadow eye components rather than like the like weird control R in terminal UI that like always lags for three seconds while it swaps tons of messages in and out I've got a live dial here of the context usage I'm tracking the APM pretty soon. That'll be like a little live ticker of the APM and We're gonna consolidate the session info here and Let's just kind of follow along here. Check the active blah blah blah It's a web application. I've got other products in here that I'm gonna enable per user. So this is the coder product I'm gonna do just like a basic chat product and then I've got like a dialer product that I'm gonna activate some of the stuff per user If you're a customer of open agents so the Main open source repo. We're gonna come back to that. It was just getting a little Complex I had the great idea to like have effect layers All throughout which is amazing. I love effect. We're gonna come back to that But I just needed to get something simple up and working first. I need to have open agents working fully orchestrating cloud codes before I get to complex with stuff Now I'll replace the entire sidebar content All right, we'll get to a PR here and then we'll Wrap up the video. That's pretty much all I have, but I want to show you a PR Create the presence face pile components convex functions Yeah, so this is just a next JS app Convex is amazing and then I've got a script running locally Just a bun script that will Do the cloud code SDK integration and save all of the data into a convex database which I can then represent here We've got kind of web socket based sync out of the box and then we're gonna be able to do very interesting things with letting agents Traverse with that history you are collecting every person using cloud code Is generating a crap ton of data in every conversation Right now that data is just sitting on your computer. I Think it auto deletes it after 30 days because mine only goes back 30 days I've been using this for longer, but like you should have an option of uploading that to a database a Convex URL of your choice or you don't want to set that up You know, that's what open agents as a service is gonna provide and then to be able to do some very interesting things with that data More on that soon. Okay, so we have a dashboard I'm not gonna release this publicly for probably another week or two or more or less. I don't know But let us know what you would like to see in a super duper dashboard See you soon

[00:00 - 00:07] If you're a power user of cloud code like me you may have seen this horrible scrolling in the T UI
[00:07 - 00:11] Terminal UI and you know, I don't know why everyone's building T. U. I's
[00:11 - 00:17] Clawed code was one and then everyone's copying off of them like can we just get a regular interface please?
[00:17 - 00:23] Okay, so I have finally broken my dependence on that horrible situation replacing it with the
[00:23 - 00:28] Gorgeous new open agents dashboard. This is a web application
[00:29 - 00:33] We're gonna go back to the desktop mobile thing. It's gonna be desktop web and mobile
[00:33 - 00:37] But for speed of iteration it was definitely fast or to pull everything into this
[00:38 - 00:43] Glorious web application which I'm using for business stuff separately, and I was just like let's just throw it all into here
[00:43 - 00:48] Okay, so what I have here is my whole cloud code workflow
[00:49 - 00:51] in a
[00:51 - 00:58] Web app, okay, so let me just kind of step through and show you my actual workflow and just let's let's do a PR together
[00:59 - 01:05] So my full workflow is I'll go over here and if I notice something oops, let's get that out of here
[01:05 - 01:10] If I notice something horrible like over here a session info
[01:10 - 01:15] There's just like too much like stuff over here. This a lot of you should be consolidated or put behind like eye things
[01:16 - 01:21] So go over here, and I'll say using my aqua voice. I hope it works with my recording going
[01:22 - 01:24] I'll say
[01:25 - 01:30] Consolidate a bunch of the app sidebar stuff. It is is that working?
[01:31 - 01:36] Yeah, consolidated a bunch of the app sidebar stuff. We don't need all those pains or
[01:37 - 01:43] Some should be combined and some of that information like configured to bugs just be put into like a little i bar
[01:44 - 01:49] Dialogue stuff hidden. There's just too much stuff there. Also, I want them to be collapsible
[01:50 - 01:54] Using the collapsible chat UI component install that if you need to
[01:55 - 02:01] Yeah, okay, so I use aqua voice. We're just like a little widget that lets you throw voice into whatever
[02:02 - 02:04] I'm not even gonna edit this. I'm just gonna say
[02:06 - 02:08] You know consolidate
[02:08 - 02:10] Session sidebar
[02:10 - 02:14] All right, so we've got issue 85 when the pop-up over to here. I'm gonna do new session
[02:15 - 02:17] I'm gonna say
[02:17 - 02:21] do issue 85 on a new work tree and
[02:23 - 02:30] Push an open PR and then I'll just go get a soda or whatever or to be fancy
[02:30 - 02:33] Why don't I go pick out a second issue right now?
[02:33 - 02:36] I've got it configured to do up to three sessions at a time
[02:36 - 02:42] I just got to play around with like what the actual rate limits are but it can theoretically handle multiple of those any other issues
[02:42 - 02:44] I want to do here
[02:44 - 02:46] I'll do a hard one this requires pulling in an external component
[02:48 - 02:52] Let's try that same thing do issue 45
[02:53 - 02:59] Oops do issue 45 on a new work tree and push and open PR
[03:00 - 03:06] Okay, so this has been my workflow. I'll just queue up like two or three of these and then I'll come back to some PRs
[03:06 - 03:10] I've got a pre-push check running a hook running to do like lens and stuff
[03:11 - 03:13] But this is just calling my
[03:14 - 03:16] Cloud code here. I've got my little task progress bar
[03:18 - 03:20] Can inspect tools
[03:21 - 03:28] Some of the stuff is just like nicer to have actual collapsible shadow eye components rather than like the like weird control
[03:28 - 03:34] R in terminal UI that like always lags for three seconds while it swaps tons of messages in and out
[03:34 - 03:38] I've got a live dial here of the context usage
[03:39 - 03:43] I'm tracking the APM pretty soon. That'll be like a little live ticker of the APM and
[03:44 - 03:46] We're gonna consolidate the session info here and
[03:47 - 03:50] Let's just kind of follow along here. Check the active blah blah blah
[03:52 - 04:00] It's a web application. I've got other products in here that I'm gonna enable per user. So this is the coder product
[04:00 - 04:07] I'm gonna do just like a basic chat product and then I've got like a dialer product that I'm gonna activate some of the stuff per user
[04:08 - 04:10] If you're a customer of open agents
[04:12 - 04:14] so the
[04:14 - 04:19] Main open source repo. We're gonna come back to that. It was just getting a little
[04:20 - 04:24] Complex I had the great idea to like have effect layers
[04:25 - 04:29] All throughout which is amazing. I love effect. We're gonna come back to that
[04:29 - 04:34] But I just needed to get something simple up and working first. I need to have
[04:35 - 04:37] open agents working
[04:38 - 04:39] fully
[04:39 - 04:42] orchestrating cloud codes before I get to complex with stuff
[04:42 - 04:45] Now I'll replace the entire sidebar content
[04:46 - 04:49] All right, we'll get to a PR here and then we'll
[04:50 - 04:54] Wrap up the video. That's pretty much all I have, but I want to show you a PR
[04:55 - 04:58] Create the presence face pile components
[04:59 - 05:01] convex functions
[05:02 - 05:04] Yeah, so this is just a next JS app
[05:04 - 05:09] Convex is amazing and then I've got a script running locally
[05:09 - 05:12] Just a bun script that will
[05:13 - 05:15] Do the cloud code SDK
[05:16 - 05:20] integration and save all of the data into a convex database which I can then represent here
[05:21 - 05:29] We've got kind of web socket based sync out of the box and then we're gonna be able to do very interesting things with letting agents
[05:29 - 05:34] Traverse with that history you are collecting every person using cloud code
[05:35 - 05:38] Is generating a crap ton of data in every conversation
[05:39 - 05:42] Right now that data is just sitting on your computer. I
[05:42 - 05:45] Think it auto deletes it after 30 days because mine only goes back 30 days
[05:45 - 05:51] I've been using this for longer, but like you should have an option of uploading that to a database a
[05:51 - 05:54] Convex URL of your choice or you don't want to set that up
[05:54 - 06:00] You know, that's what open agents as a service is gonna provide and then to be able to do some very interesting things with that data
[06:00 - 06:04] More on that soon. Okay, so we have a dashboard
[06:04 - 06:06] I'm not gonna release this
[06:06 - 06:09] publicly for probably another week or two or more or less. I don't know
[06:10 - 06:14] But let us know what you would like to see in a super duper dashboard
[06:15 - 06:17] See you soon
