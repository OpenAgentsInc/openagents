## Full Transcript

And we're back. Took a great 30 day pause off of X and so aside from building our core software business, boring, spent a lot of time thinking about what is the proper product that's going to tie together all the epic ground that we've covered in the last 190-ish videos. Commander and mobile app and MCP and Bitcoin integration and the agent store and all this stuff that we've done like how do we put all this into a product and my previous thinking was like we're going to build this desktop app called Commander to move away from the like code editor cursor type interfaces towards this sort of gamified hood-based interface. It should feel more like Starcraft managing all your agents and you know the big leap that I've made in the last few weeks is that the proper sort introductory product for all this shouldn't just be some gamified hood UI. It should be an actual game and then maybe that game starts overlapping into the real world. So open agents has acquired a game studio for a dollar from me and my wife and we were making an MMORPG and we just launched the first build of it an hour ago. So it's called RuinsOfAtlantis.com RuinsOfAtlantis is the game you can read more about the why in my background with games and why I'm doing this and why this has been cooking for so long. But just just start thinking just start thinking what would an MMORPG that has powerful AI agents as part of it or Bitcoin integration or other interesting real world integrations. We're not going to say much more about those kinds of things we're going to be rolling them out in a very gradual but accelerated and fast way I think in our weekly releases of RuinsOfAtlantis. So we'll do other kind of more generic agent content on this current series but we're going to be focusing a lot on this MMO and I hope that you follow along. See you soon.

[00:00 - 00:07] And we're back. Took a great 30 day pause off of X and so aside from building our
[00:07 - 00:12] core software business, boring, spent a lot of time thinking about what is the
[00:12 - 00:16] proper product that's going to tie together all the epic ground that we've covered
[00:16 - 00:23] in the last 190-ish videos. Commander and mobile app and MCP and Bitcoin
[00:23 - 00:28] integration and the agent store and all this stuff that we've done like how
[00:28 - 00:32] do we put all this into a product and my previous thinking was like we're
[00:32 - 00:37] going to build this desktop app called Commander to move away from the like code
[00:37 - 00:42] editor cursor type interfaces towards this sort of gamified hood-based
[00:42 - 00:48] interface. It should feel more like Starcraft managing all your agents and you
[00:48 - 00:54] know the big leap that I've made in the last few weeks is that the proper sort
[00:54 - 01:01] introductory product for all this shouldn't just be some gamified hood UI. It should
[01:01 - 01:08] be an actual game and then maybe that game starts overlapping into the real
[01:08 - 01:17] world. So open agents has acquired a game studio for a dollar from me and my wife
[01:17 - 01:26] and we were making an MMORPG and we just launched the first build of it an hour
[01:26 - 01:32] ago. So it's called RuinsOfAtlantis.com RuinsOfAtlantis is the game you can
[01:32 - 01:37] read more about the why in my background with games and why I'm doing this and
[01:37 - 01:42] why this has been cooking for so long. But just just start thinking just start
[01:42 - 01:49] thinking what would an MMORPG that has powerful AI agents as part of it or Bitcoin
[01:49 - 01:56] integration or other interesting real world integrations. We're not going to say much more
[01:56 - 02:01] about those kinds of things we're going to be rolling them out in a very gradual but
[02:01 - 02:09] accelerated and fast way I think in our weekly releases of RuinsOfAtlantis. So we'll do
[02:10 - 02:16] other kind of more generic agent content on this current series but we're going to be focusing a lot
[02:16 - 02:21] on this MMO and I hope that you follow along. See you soon.
