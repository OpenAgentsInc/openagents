## Full Transcript

We said hello, Claude code, and it's only polite to also say, goodbye. I waited a month to record this video because didn't want to get like roped back in. Like I did the previous month, I tried to cancel and just didn't have an alternative. Codex is now awesome, more on that in a bit about the current workflow and what we're doing with that. But wanted to take a look through what Claude recently put out and kind of the reviews of them trying to make an expansion into more mobile, centric workflows. And I just don't like, I just don't think it's good enough. Let's just kind of take a spin through this and then tee up what we're doing next with Open Agents. So Anthropics Coding Agent promises work from anywhere. After a weekend of testing, it still feels very beta. Coding manually from your phone has been possible in theory. The dream is being able to kick off a Claude code session on my laptop and then keep it running in the cloud. I go to a meeting. Is Anthropics Cloud and mobile version the one that finally delivers? Short answer not yet. OK, so I don't really want necessarily to be like head to head competitor of what these labs are trying to do. I've clearly distinguished the kind of stuff that I want to be building. But the thing is, I still need the best coding setup. I have to upgrade my own workflow. That's a constant work in progress. I'll always need to have the best stuff. And the main thing that has pissed me off about Claude code is just that it has not been open source and trying to get even the Claude code SDK working, trying to authenticate it from a remote server. Just everything has been to paint the butt. Stuff's not well documented. Whereas with Codex, I can just go look at the code. I can use Codex as is, or I can just strip out the rust code, throw it into something else, and off very easily by dropping a SQL JSON thing in. So the fact that it's all open and inspectable and modifiable is like in conjunction with the models being super powerful. It's like really happy to use that. OK, so we're going to be doing our own sort of, I guess you could call it a competition competitor product to what Claude code has here. Mobile app synced up with some sort of desktop situation in a web app situation. More on that tomorrow. See you soon.

[00:00 - 00:05] We said hello, Claude code, and it's only polite to also say,
[00:05 - 00:06] goodbye.
[00:06 - 00:10] I waited a month to record this video because didn't want
[00:10 - 00:12] to get like roped back in.
[00:12 - 00:14] Like I did the previous month, I tried to cancel and just
[00:14 - 00:16] didn't have an alternative.
[00:16 - 00:19] Codex is now awesome, more on that in a bit about the current
[00:19 - 00:22] workflow and what we're doing with that.
[00:22 - 00:25] But wanted to take a look through what Claude recently put
[00:25 - 00:27] out and kind of the reviews of them
[00:27 - 00:33] trying to make an expansion into more mobile, centric workflows.
[00:33 - 00:39] And I just don't like, I just don't think it's good enough.
[00:39 - 00:42] Let's just kind of take a spin through this and then tee up
[00:42 - 00:44] what we're doing next with Open Agents.
[00:44 - 00:47] So Anthropics Coding Agent promises work from anywhere.
[00:47 - 00:52] After a weekend of testing, it still feels very beta.
[00:52 - 00:54] Coding manually from your phone has been possible in theory.
[00:54 - 00:58] The dream is being able to kick off a Claude code session on my
[00:58 - 00:59] laptop and then keep it running in the cloud.
[00:59 - 01:01] I go to a meeting.
[01:01 - 01:04] Is Anthropics Cloud and mobile version the one that finally
[01:04 - 01:04] delivers?
[01:04 - 01:07] Short answer not yet.
[01:07 - 01:12] OK, so I don't really want necessarily to be like head to head
[01:12 - 01:15] competitor of what these labs are trying to do.
[01:15 - 01:19] I've clearly distinguished the kind of stuff that I want to be
[01:19 - 01:20] building.
[01:20 - 01:24] But the thing is, I still need the best coding setup.
[01:24 - 01:26] I have to upgrade my own workflow.
[01:26 - 01:31] That's a constant work in progress.
[01:31 - 01:33] I'll always need to have the best stuff.
[01:33 - 01:36] And the main thing that has pissed me off about Claude code is just
[01:36 - 01:41] that it has not been open source and trying to get even the
[01:41 - 01:46] Claude code SDK working, trying to authenticate it from a remote
[01:46 - 01:47] server.
[01:47 - 01:48] Just everything has been to paint the butt.
[01:48 - 01:49] Stuff's not well documented.
[01:49 - 01:52] Whereas with Codex, I can just go look at the code.
[01:52 - 01:56] I can use Codex as is, or I can just strip out the rust code,
[01:56 - 02:00] throw it into something else, and off very easily by dropping
[02:00 - 02:01] a SQL JSON thing in.
[02:01 - 02:04] So the fact that it's all open and inspectable and modifiable
[02:04 - 02:06] is like in conjunction with the models being super powerful.
[02:06 - 02:09] It's like really happy to use that.
[02:09 - 02:12] OK, so we're going to be doing our own sort of, I guess you
[02:12 - 02:17] could call it a competition competitor product to what
[02:17 - 02:19] Claude code has here.
[02:19 - 02:23] Mobile app synced up with some sort of desktop situation
[02:23 - 02:25] in a web app situation.
[02:25 - 02:27] More on that tomorrow.
[02:27 - 02:28] See you soon.
