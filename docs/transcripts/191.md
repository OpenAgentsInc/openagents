## Full Transcript

You would think that with the hundreds of billions of dollars in VC money coming into the AI space, that someone would have created a good mobile app for coding on the go. No, nothing. I'm not talking about terminals, remote terminals, the type with a little keyboard, or an IDE, I mean, like, give me an app that lets me manage and talk to my coding agents on the go. If I'm sitting on the pot, why am I scrolling X when I could be scrolling like updates from my coding agent? Does in exist. And before you say, have you tried that one? Is it open source? No, go fuck yourself. Okay, it's got to be open source. We're not doing code source bullshit, sir. Okay, here is the first commit done by our agent here. So this conversation here is, hey, edit agents.md to include a comprehensive summary. This is talking to my desktop over tail scale VPN and it made this commit and it worked. Okay, so this code base, all open source, this code base is like a day old and it's already works. I'm able to walk around my house with my phone and it talks to my desktop. Okay, good start. Opening AI codex, blah, blah, blah. Why are we doing this? There's no good mobile app for managing coding agents while AFK. Coding agents CLI is like codex are good enough to handle most day-to-day coding such that devs almost never be need to be in the editor. I said in a video like six months ago, I only need to be in the editor like 10% of the time and I predicted that that would follow the zero. It's essentially followed the zero. I'm in the editor maybe 1% of the time. I really don't need to be there. K is like, I just need to kind of like see generally what the agents are doing but like these agents are really freaking good. My point back then and it's certainly reinforced now is that people are not going to need to be sitting behind their computers, being glued to the latest billion dollar IDE, fuck IDE's they're on the way out. The name of the game is async agents and you just need some some way of managing your async agents. It should be a mobile app. Nice little push notification. Hey, ping, you know, check on this cool. The only reason we're still glued to our computers most of the time is because there's no good way to code on your phone. And I don't mean actually coding, I mean managing your coding agents to like have them create a code. Remote terminals are not good enough. The labs bolted on code bullshit or underpowered afterthoughts. We want unrestricted codex and other agents running async keeping us just updated enough to nudge them along when needed. And that nudging along should get less and less as the agents get better and better. And as our harness evolves and gets more sophisticated to say, do this eight different agents and talk to each other about what. A good agent frees you from your computer doesn't tie you to it. So we're doing a project called tricoder like a tricorder, but for coding. Yeah, I'll put this up on test flight in a few days. If someone really wants to add cloud code support, they can do that. We may do it eventually, but codex is what we're starting with. Okay. Jason

[00:00 - 00:05] You would think that with the hundreds of billions of dollars in VC money coming into the AI space,
[00:05 - 00:10] that someone would have created a good mobile app for coding on the go.
[00:10 - 00:12] No, nothing.
[00:12 - 00:16] I'm not talking about terminals, remote terminals, the type with a little keyboard,
[00:16 - 00:21] or an IDE, I mean, like, give me an app that lets me manage and talk to my coding agents on the go.
[00:21 - 00:26] If I'm sitting on the pot, why am I scrolling X when I could be scrolling like updates from my coding agent?
[00:26 - 00:28] Does in exist.
[00:28 - 00:30] And before you say, have you tried that one?
[00:30 - 00:31] Is it open source?
[00:31 - 00:33] No, go fuck yourself.
[00:33 - 00:34] Okay, it's got to be open source.
[00:34 - 00:36] We're not doing code source bullshit, sir.
[00:36 - 00:41] Okay, here is the first commit done by our agent here.
[00:41 - 00:47] So this conversation here is, hey, edit agents.md to include a comprehensive summary.
[00:47 - 00:56] This is talking to my desktop over tail scale VPN and it made this commit and it worked.
[00:56 - 01:03] Okay, so this code base, all open source, this code base is like a day old and it's already works.
[01:03 - 01:06] I'm able to walk around my house with my phone and it talks to my desktop.
[01:06 - 01:08] Okay, good start.
[01:08 - 01:11] Opening AI codex, blah, blah, blah.
[01:11 - 01:12] Why are we doing this?
[01:12 - 01:15] There's no good mobile app for managing coding agents while AFK.
[01:15 - 01:22] Coding agents CLI is like codex are good enough to handle most day-to-day coding such that devs almost never be need to be in the editor.
[01:22 - 01:28] I said in a video like six months ago, I only need to be in the editor like 10% of the time and I predicted that that would follow the zero.
[01:28 - 01:29] It's essentially followed the zero.
[01:29 - 01:31] I'm in the editor maybe 1% of the time.
[01:31 - 01:33] I really don't need to be there.
[01:33 - 01:38] K is like, I just need to kind of like see generally what the agents are doing but like these agents are really freaking good.
[01:38 - 01:44] My point back then and it's certainly reinforced now is that people are not going to need to be sitting behind their computers,
[01:44 - 01:49] being glued to the latest billion dollar IDE, fuck IDE's they're on the way out.
[01:49 - 01:55] The name of the game is async agents and you just need some some way of managing your async agents.
[01:55 - 01:56] It should be a mobile app.
[01:56 - 01:57] Nice little push notification.
[01:57 - 02:00] Hey, ping, you know, check on this cool.
[02:00 - 02:05] The only reason we're still glued to our computers most of the time is because there's no good way to code on your phone.
[02:05 - 02:11] And I don't mean actually coding, I mean managing your coding agents to like have them create a code.
[02:11 - 02:12] Remote terminals are not good enough.
[02:12 - 02:16] The labs bolted on code bullshit or underpowered afterthoughts.
[02:16 - 02:22] We want unrestricted codex and other agents running async keeping us just updated enough to nudge them along when needed.
[02:22 - 02:26] And that nudging along should get less and less as the agents get better and better.
[02:26 - 02:33] And as our harness evolves and gets more sophisticated to say, do this eight different agents and talk to each other about what.
[02:33 - 02:41] A good agent frees you from your computer doesn't tie you to it.
[02:41 - 02:50] So we're doing a project called tricoder like a tricorder, but for coding.
[02:50 - 02:55] Yeah, I'll put this up on test flight in a few days.
[02:55 - 02:58] If someone really wants to add cloud code support, they can do that.
[02:58 - 03:05] We may do it eventually, but codex is what we're starting with.
[03:05 - 03:07] Okay.
