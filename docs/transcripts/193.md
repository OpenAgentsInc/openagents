Yes, really you can now code from your phone with codex or Clawed code with a single and px command a Single button to scan the qr code and my devices are now paired you'll see the log streaming and I'll say hello Codex who are you and you'll see the log streaming in this is talking to your local codex install and you say you know What codex isn't being too smart today? Let's pop over to Clawed code new chat Clawed code Who are you? And of course Clawed will kind of think about it for a second and give you an essay about What Clawed things and feels okay, so this is a app live now in test flight got the history there I'm excited for Developers to experience what I experienced last week where I had probably my single greatest increase daily increase in my own personal productivity Just getting this working walking around my house and talking to it figured out how to Get this QR code thing working sustainably for other people where now you have two options If you run it like this Just with the basics and nothing else. There's no account needed it just connects it exposes this over your local area network So your devices need to be on the same Wi-Fi network no account needed for that if I go up here and I flip on my tail scale VPN This same script will auto detect that I'm running tail scale and I'll say tail scale and now it's the exact same flow But now I can take my phone elsewhere in the world and as long as I am My desktop is running I'll be able to chat with it from the grocery store or wherever I'm at I don't think any other app enables that at least not in like a nice pretty mobile app like this when I say pretty I mean this code base is like a Week old so the UI is still very rough, but now that we've got the hard parts Done we're just gonna rapidly add features another kind of quality of life stuff one thing I want to add is like much better voice transcription probably via GROQ GROQ and That's about it. We're open to pull requests. All this is a hundred percent open source by the way Thank you key are giving us some stuff there Knits are welcome to if they got good PRs attached or so all this is a hundred percent open source I would not run anything like this if it was not a hundred percent open source What else live now on test flame you can join the Android wait list by tweeting at us When Android We got docs that are decent mostly AI generated, but anything that is not clear that is not documented there Please DM or tweet at us What else we have the tricotor scripts is on npx you need to be on 024 at minimum But generally if you run npx tricotor at latest you'll get the something the thing that's pretty much guaranteed to work I wanted to take a look at one little fun thing here which was Yeah open source successor to super maven this little like lightweight Completion thing that worked in NeoVim and stuff acquired by cursor so they said when the blog posts came out Yeah super maven will remain maintained, but it is now no longer going to be maintained. It's going to be sunset Ironclad dev here says this is my 9 11 and I will never forgive cursor for this Cursor huh hey cursor what's cursor's valuation? See you soon guys

[00:00 - 00:04] Yes, really you can now code from your phone with codex or
[00:04 - 00:06] Clawed code
[00:06 - 00:09] with a single and px command a
[00:09 - 00:19] Single button to scan the qr code and my devices are now paired you'll see the log streaming and I'll say hello
[00:19 - 00:27] Codex who are you and you'll see the log streaming in this is talking to your local codex install and you say you know
[00:27 - 00:35] What codex isn't being too smart today? Let's pop over to Clawed code new chat Clawed code
[00:36 - 00:38] Who are you?
[00:40 - 00:45] And of course Clawed will kind of think about it for a second and give you an essay about
[00:46 - 00:49] What Clawed things and feels okay, so this is a
[00:50 - 00:54] app live now in test flight got the history there
[00:55 - 00:57] I'm excited for
[00:57 - 01:02] Developers to experience what I experienced last week where I had probably my single
[01:02 - 01:06] greatest increase daily increase in my own personal productivity
[01:07 - 01:10] Just getting this working walking around my house and talking to it
[01:11 - 01:13] figured out how to
[01:13 - 01:18] Get this QR code thing working sustainably for other people where now you have two options
[01:18 - 01:20] If you run it like this
[01:21 - 01:28] Just with the basics and nothing else. There's no account needed it just connects it exposes this over your local area network
[01:28 - 01:36] So your devices need to be on the same Wi-Fi network no account needed for that if I go up here and I flip on my tail scale VPN
[01:37 - 01:41] This same script will auto detect that I'm running tail scale and
[01:41 - 01:45] I'll say tail scale and now it's the exact same flow
[01:45 - 01:51] But now I can take my phone elsewhere in the world and as long as I am
[01:51 - 01:56] My desktop is running I'll be able to chat with it from the grocery store or wherever I'm at
[01:56 - 02:02] I don't think any other app enables that at least not in like a nice pretty mobile app like this when I say pretty
[02:02 - 02:04] I mean this code base is like a
[02:04 - 02:08] Week old so the UI is still very rough, but now that we've got the hard parts
[02:09 - 02:14] Done we're just gonna rapidly add features another kind of quality of life stuff one thing
[02:14 - 02:19] I want to add is like much better voice transcription probably via GROQ GROQ and
[02:21 - 02:26] That's about it. We're open to pull requests. All this is a hundred percent open source by the way
[02:26 - 02:29] Thank you key are giving us some stuff there
[02:29 - 02:33] Knits are welcome to if they got good PRs attached or so all this is a hundred percent open source
[02:33 - 02:37] I would not run anything like this if it was not a hundred percent open source
[02:38 - 02:43] What else live now on test flame you can join the Android wait list by tweeting at us
[02:43 - 02:45] When Android
[02:45 - 02:52] We got docs that are decent mostly AI generated, but anything that is not clear that is not documented there
[02:52 - 02:55] Please DM or tweet at us
[02:55 - 03:02] What else we have the tricotor scripts is on npx you need to be on 024 at minimum
[03:02 - 03:08] But generally if you run npx tricotor at latest you'll get the something the thing that's pretty much guaranteed to work
[03:08 - 03:12] I wanted to take a look at one little fun thing here which was
[03:13 - 03:15] Yeah
[03:15 - 03:20] open source successor to super maven this little like lightweight
[03:21 - 03:27] Completion thing that worked in NeoVim and stuff acquired by cursor so they said when the blog posts came out
[03:27 - 03:33] Yeah super maven will remain maintained, but it is now no longer going to be maintained. It's going to be sunset
[03:34 - 03:39] Ironclad dev here says this is my 9 11 and I will never forgive cursor for this
[03:40 - 03:42] Cursor huh hey
[03:42 - 03:44] cursor what's cursor's valuation?
[03:45 - 03:47] See you soon guys
