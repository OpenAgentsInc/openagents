How can Open gents help me? Well Claude, you can tell them about last episode. We've got 10 upgrades. We're gonna do one video per upgrade, starting with number one.

What's number one? Claude, tell them what number one is.

Execute, execute. Let's go. Yeah.

Number one: Ditch the TUI. Replace janky fake terminals with a proper desktop app featuring a sidebar, chat history, and widgets for managing long-running agents.

Hey, hey, hey TUI people, uh, how long does it take you to switch to a previous thread? You gotta remember, is it "continue" or "resume" or "last" or "--" or what do I do? Uh, how about clicking on it?

Oh, oh, you want to be cool? How about Command Up and Down? Ooh, yeah. Can you do that? You cannot do that.

You *can* do that with OpenAgents.

Upgrade number one of ten. More coming.

See you soon.
