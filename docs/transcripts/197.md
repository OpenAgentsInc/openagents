The year is 1900 and the world's best investors have poured a lot of money into the company building a faster horse Congratulations to cursor. I know that cursor is reading our tweets. I Know the cursor is reading our tweets. I hope they enjoy this one That's Starcraft. This isn't King Starcraft. Okay. It's good. It's good. It's good. So Follow up from our our last video. So ditch the to you. Why you know, you got to also ditch your old ID Okay, so is it something rubs me wrong? I have to say when you take an open source product You fork it and you close source it and you build a bunch of stuff on top first of all I think the model's all wrong But something about that just rubs me wrong Anyways Bro, what do you need two billion dollars for do you need to is that for buying out people like me because you're gonna need a lot more than that Okay, so we're gonna reverse engineer cursor, but look look look look look look hang on hang on hang on lawyer gpt Says I should say this in this video works for in cursor purely for educational interoperability purposes all the code He produces entirely original under U.S. Law provisions for yada yada yada. Okay, great. So You'll take a look on our open source repo We got some cool stuff in a new folder called doc slash r e Cursor and you know cursor is just sitting on your computer. You can just have the agents like look at it So we got a little deep research report about cursors architecture from stuff you can find online and then had our coding And just take a look at like what's going on locally? For example, you can like look at all of the node modules that they use be curious to see someone run it run this through NPM audit and just see if there's any Problems there. Oh, thumbs up. Oh Well, so we got here comparing the dependencies of cursor versus VS code like what are they added on top of VS code? How does that map to architecture Themes nice themes I like them good job and What starts speculating about like how would we combine some of the local stuff that we've been talking about? Not depending so much on their cloud stuff, but they go with a more local version of that look like and then I Fed at the transcript of our episode 195. I was like, yeah, what happens if we were to just kind of like do our own version of all this What it's a down here hand What is it on here hang on hang on so the bunch of stuff I'm not gonna go through all this but like I Was a lot very good job gpt 5 Hang on there's something I want to show you wait, okay weeks. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Who wrote this roadmap Claude probably Claude? One Once you can spec something out and you got like a good model for it like the creation of software time and money all that's falling to zero and A lot of people companies investors have not grappled with the ramifications of that Holy shit, okay, this is what I was trying to show you Six weeks to MVP 20 weeks to 10x better than cursor guys Six days Max to MVP 20 days to 10x better than cursor. I don't think we need all that time See you soon

[00:36 - 00:41] Okay, so is it something rubs me wrong? I have to say when you take an open source product
[00:41 - 00:46] You fork it and you close source it and you build a bunch of stuff on top first of all I think the model's all wrong
[00:46 - 00:48] But something about that just rubs me wrong
[00:48 - 00:50] Anyways
[00:50 - 00:56] Bro, what do you need two billion dollars for do you need to is that for buying out people like me because you're gonna need a lot more than that
[00:56 - 01:04] Okay, so we're gonna reverse engineer cursor, but look look look look look look hang on hang on hang on lawyer gpt
[01:05 - 01:10] Says I should say this in this video works for in cursor purely for educational interoperability purposes all the code
[01:10 - 01:14] He produces entirely original under U.S. Law provisions for yada yada yada. Okay, great. So
[01:15 - 01:17] You'll take a look on our open source repo
[01:18 - 01:22] We got some cool stuff in a new folder called doc slash r e
[01:22 - 01:27] Cursor and you know cursor is just sitting on your computer. You can just have the agents like look at it
[01:27 - 01:33] So we got a little deep research report about cursors architecture from stuff you can find online and then had our coding
[01:33 - 01:35] And just take a look at like what's going on locally?
[01:35 - 01:41] For example, you can like look at all of the node modules that they use be curious to see someone run it run this through
[01:42 - 01:44] NPM audit and just see if there's any
[01:44 - 01:46] Problems there. Oh, thumbs up. Oh
[01:47 - 01:53] Well, so we got here comparing the dependencies of cursor versus VS code like what are they added on top of VS code?
[01:54 - 01:56] How does that map to architecture
[01:58 - 02:00] Themes nice themes I like them good job and
[02:02 - 02:08] What starts speculating about like how would we combine some of the local stuff that we've been talking about?
[02:09 - 02:15] Not depending so much on their cloud stuff, but they go with a more local version of that look like and then I
[02:15 - 02:22] Fed at the transcript of our episode 195. I was like, yeah, what happens if we were to just kind of like do our own version of all this

[03:08 - 03:10] the creation of software
[03:11 - 03:13] time and money

[03:16 - 03:20] A lot of people companies investors have not grappled with the ramifications of that
[03:22 - 03:24] Holy shit, okay, this is what I was trying to show you
[03:25 - 03:29] Six weeks to MVP 20 weeks to 10x better than cursor guys
[03:32 - 03:34] Six days
[03:35 - 03:40] Max to MVP 20 days to 10x better than cursor. I don't think we need all that time
[03:41 - 03:43] See you soon
