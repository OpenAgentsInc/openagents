 Welcome to the 12th and final night of Open Agents. You know, we said two weeks ago, we're gonna launch a mobile app in two weeks. We're gonna do 12 nights of Open Agents. And by night 12, we'll launch the coolest, awesome, bestest open source, truly open AI agent app and product that should bootstrap a global decentralized AI agents marketplace. We did. The app isn't there yet. Clearly, we've got a lot more to do. But we have an app. It's out. You can use it. We just did the first update today. We'll talk a little bit about that. But yeah, I just want to step through some thoughts about what OpenAI has released and what we've released and what we're going to do moving forward. First of all, openagents.com has the updated download links. Test flight lags behind Android depending on the review schedule. So if you sign up for that, you'll still only have 001 until they approve the review. Android, you can go click and read the release notes and download it via the APK link right there or do directly there. I just added some stability. We added Lama 3.2b, so you can click models up there and switch between the two models. You can delete them from your phone, download them there. So it should just be a little smoother, better. Okay, connect, blah, blah, blah. That all worked fine. So let's take a look. What did OpenAI release today? What did they release today? Okay, here's what I wanted them to release. Wait, wait, wait. this is what I wanted them to release Mr. Fodor here says he was guessing that ooh before he left OpenAI Andre Carpethi said he's building a kind of Jarvis at OpenAI and he said that's my guess I would really hope that they do that too because closed AI building a Jarvis versus open agents building a Jarvis like that's the whole kind of idea behind Onyx it's your personal Jarvis in your pocket like let's compete about that this is the fight that I want this 150 video series that began as a response to OpenAI's GPT store, which I thought they were going to half-ass and do shitty like it was. We're going to do our own version, basically, of OpenAI's product suite starting with GPT store in an open way. That's what we've been kind of cranking on for the last year. So I was like, okay, let's battle about Jarvis. What did they actually ship? A blog post. I was all thinking, oh, they might do GPT 4.5 or agents or tasks or something like we got a cool model We took a model and we combined it with a bunch of other kind of chains of thought into one big trench coat and we call it a model and we spend millions of tokens and $10,000 on tokens and, yeah, it's going to be great. Here's some pieces of paper that says it's going to be great. Great job, OpenAI. So, they shipped evals for a reason or model. We are shipping Jarvis as an app anyone in the world can use. Let's check in this time next year to see which mattered more. Smiley face. So, I'm calling this video Neutrality Wins. Because I want to introduce this concept. and there have been a few other concepts, call them principles, that we've gone over. We've kind of fleshed out over the last year and I want to add this one to it. Anything else I want to go into before that? No, let's start here. Okay, so let's just kind of recap. So open agents, top left, what are we doing here? Well, AI agents will soon outnumber humans. There will be billions of these things. I mean, Elon says that he's going to be, he thinks they'll be producing like a billion optimist robots per year so if robots are going to outnumber humans at you know in the next decade or two you better believe agents will get there first because software is going to proliferate way faster so given billions of agents um i hope that we know a majority of those are doing what their code is what their data is what their weights is So for true AI safety, we need those agents to be as open as possible. That's potentially existential. You can envision all sorts of bad scenarios ranging from Orwellian dystopia to agents interfering with nuclear weapons systems. Who knows? But we've got to know what these agents are doing. Open agents. Agents should be open. Let's do that. One market. So we did a video on this. we are liberating frontier AI from captured centralized corporations who will not be building open agents by building one decentralized global marketplace of AI agents and services. You can read our one market video last week for more on the thesis of that Part of how we build one market is through this concept of incentivize interop so we building this sort of like one we think one agent-centric web there's a bunch of people like companies now trying to build infrastructure to help companies um kind of speak agent or let agents traverse the data of a bunch of different companies i think a whole bunch of different people are going to be kind of plugging things into this one broader call it agent-centric web. And I think that it's going to have its own network effect. And that network effect is going to reward people who make the web traversable or who can traverse the web, bringing down friction for agents because agents are going to want to have access to the more things that they can access, the more valuable they'll be. And anyone who's not participating in this, who's just sitting behind a walled garden will not get the benefits of this. So if you cooperate, you get paid because people are going to be, we think, transacting more and more in this more open and agentic economy. If you decline to participate, just try and shore up your moat. If you're just going to sit behind your big walls as a public company and count your money, I think that's going to diminish. And then how we can more directly kind of encourage people to join this network is by just paying them, paying them rev share. Hey, if you refer us a client, we're going to give you a stream of the Bitcoin, stream of whatever they pay us to you in Bitcoin on a recurring basis forever. That's a pretty compelling selling point, I think, to start kind of building up this one network that has these kind of like streams of micropayments going out permissionlessly in Bitcoin to everybody all the time. Bitcoin only. Bitcoin is the logical payment mechanism, currency, and payment, more importantly, payment rails that we think a lot of the machine-to-machine payments, a lot of the Asian payments are just going to be coming to Bitcoin. There's always going to be some shitcoiners that are doing things, but I think if you haven't seen this talk, if you look on YouTube for the Bitcoin stack, great talk from Bitcoin 2021 to help open my eyes about, oh, actually a lot of the kinds of things that are being built in these unstable ways on change other than Bitcoin are going to be migrating, and you already started to see this happen, to the Bitcoin stack generally, not necessarily to the base layer of Bitcoin, but to Bitcoin and the like different layers that are gonna be built around that So Bitcoin layers like layer two like lightning for fast payments or as well as adjacent things like nostre and other kind of key based uh structures here okay so the other concept that i want to throw out there is we'll call it neutrality wins and we've kind of seen some of this um with the the phrase model agnostic like we have had like our very first product with open agents was we're putting out a chat interface that allows you to use open ai models and cloud models with the same interface this was solving my own pain point back a year plus ago where i was like with cloud three had just come out and i was like paying open ai 20 a month i was paying cloud 20 a month like why don't i just build a single interface that just uses the apis and then that was our first product we charged ten dollars a for that that's cool we can do that we it's great to be model agnostic just use whatever's the best you know at one point we had like you know 15 different models from seven different providers and that was really cool the big labs are not going to do that google's not going to use anthropics models open ai is not going to use google's models like these people are fighting each other for turf you know bad for them good for us so will the like category defining industry, defining products and apps that use these AI models, are they going to come out of the big labs? I don't think so. They're not set up for that. So a neutral player can use it all. Neutrality prevents rent seeking and enables value for value. So rent seeking would be like, hey, use my Web3 protocol. we built an agent framework you'll use a token I hold a bunch of the token this will enrich me and maybe you'll get some token that's kind of the pitch of a lot of these web 3 companies building frameworks that use a token it's a completely graft on bolt on bullshit like use my token but the token has no actual utility but they make something the function of a lot of that shit-coiner is just to enrich the founding team. And it's not neutral. And I've been in this position, and I'm vocal about this, because that used to be me. I ran one of those projects seven years ago.

 I've seen in retrospect how much it warps your thinking. It takes you away from shipping product and solving people's actual problems. And you think you have a big incentive to think in terms of like what pumps the price of my token. And then you attract a whole bunch of people around you who are like also caring about that primarily. It does not lend itself to like shipping product and delivering real value. so that kind of both like token based crap as well as there's a bunch of on the other side like vc backed companies that are building kind of what you'd call proprietary picks and shovels companies where they think that people are going to use their infrastructure or framework or something to build agents like no no not necessarily if i need to like get an api key from you to run my business, I'm not going to do that. I have the same access to this technology that pretty much anyone else does. So why build dependencies on third parties, particularly when their incentives are not going to be aligned with yours? If you're building on one of those companies and then they sell to Google tomorrow, which is what a lot of these companies would count as a win, selling out to the fucking evil empire people that are trying to play regulatory capture games. We don't want to build. We can't build on that. We have to build on things that are neutral and that are rock solid. What's rock solid? Bitcoin is rock solid. Lightning is rock solid. The companies that are building on those tend to be rock solid because they're building. It's harder to raise money. You have to actually run good businesses. Like it just people are higher integrity. Just the Bitcoin space makes sense for this. and then you know technically aside from the bitcoin and kind of payments related things to use data there's like equivalents that kind of are in line with the bitcoin principles like nostra there's other public key cryptography things like that we're using nostra at least to start but as you saw like in the nostra data vending machines video this is a great way for projects to to be able to rapidly use the same standards to build up kind of this idea of one market, one liquidity. Like right now you got 15 different Nostra clients a lot of them kind of Twitter clones or other kind of takes on social media apps and because they all speak Nostra they all have access to the same pool of data It's like one liquidity pool, one pool of posts. And this gets around the cold start problem. If you have an idea for a client where you want a particular algorithm to be a particular way, you have access to the same data that everybody else does. You just have your client then pull in the data that you want. as really powerful. And I expect to see that kind of concept apply also to AI services. Why are you going to trust that some particular company is going to build up their own agent marketplace and have their own network effect that's better than what the accumulated everyone else collectively working together is going to do? No. No single company is going to be able to outperform what everyone else working together can do. So that's kind of the major theme here. It's like, don't do one thing by yourself. Let's figure out how to build on these, has to be neutral open protocols. And that lends itself to all sorts of cool things where I don't need to do everything myself. I'll give an example of Jordy from Fusats, also doing Bitcoin lightning kind of agent infrastructure stuff. a year ago i was saying i need to hire an l402 expert to build out our infrastructure that has the like lightning payments that work with our agents and like oh let me raise no wait a second meet jordy figure out what he's doing and what he'll be good at doing and what i'll be good at doing it's like oh he's the guy that's like the expert that if i need to talk to someone about that or work with him that solves that piece because we're both building on bitcoin and lightning we know that all of this the tech that decisions that we're making are going to be interoperable with each other interoperability that matters a lot um ai similar thing huge props to anthropic for putting out that model context protocol we did a video on that um the future is open protocols and it was a little surprising to me that anthropic which has been you know i've had kind of a love-hate relationship with because i love sonnet i use it so much and then they're Dario's one of these people flying to DC and scaring the hell out of the regulators about AI safety and this bullshit. So it like love relationship but the fact that they threw their chips on hey we going to build this open protocol nothing in it is tied or proprietary to Anthropic So you can have open protocols that have companies backing them And I envision that we will probably do something similar where we may put out some particular specification or set of standards as a protocol, probably grafting onto Nostr, for example. I've written one and a half NIPs, Nostr Improvement Protocols, in the past. So I'm a contributor to the protocol. I can very easily probably write another specification specifically for if we decide that the things that we're doing in agent land need some specific specification for projects to be able to speak the same language that's not covered by the existing NIPs. Then we can just write that and add it, and that will be voluntary and opt-in in the same way that the rest of the Nostra ecosystem is. But it's not like anyone's going to be subject to what a company does. you can take the pieces that you like and leave off the pieces that you don't like. So taken together, these are really the five principles that drive our decisions as open agents. And just to give a little more color on this, just a few tweets. So Dax, prominent developer guy, says, you don't pay for SaaS for the code they wrote. Otherwise, open source clones would always win. You pay for operating the SaaS. But the cost of operating software is being driven to zero. It's becoming self-operating. What happens then? Then, everything collapses into one market built on open protocols, facilitating interop and minimizing friction so agents can access all of it. Think blocks, TV decks, but for data, tools, workflows, business logic, customer relationships. You can Google that for the white paper to read about. building this decentralized exchange. It's like a web of different providers making different trade-offs around custody and such. Agents won't sign up for your wait list and they won't talk to your salespeople. We will rebuild your company's whole product suite in that time and connect it to the one market that solves distribution for all participants. The midwit VC takes about vertical agents thinking vertical agents will look like SaaS did. The Y Combinator people specifically predicted that vertical agents will produce 300 unicorns in 20 years, just like SAS did, but I think there's no fucking way. Agents will conquer all verticals but there no reason for that to be 300 separate siloed companies How is any one company going to compete with the accumulated mass of everyone else in the world trying to solve that same problem Crowds. Incentivized interoperability. Building on a single protocol stack that's neutral. Markets. Markets. Market. It will all collapse to one market on neutral open protocols, no VC blockchains or proprietary picks and shovels, and on the open monetary network, Bitcoin only, so no shitcoins needed ever. Unicorns, axes, robots, we're coming after the unicorns. We want them. We're hungry. Yeah, this is the YC interview that I was responding to where their main agent guy was like, oh, well, there'll be 300 agent unicorns. No, you would love there to be 300 agent unicorns because you'll get a piece of a bunch of them, but I don't think so. I don't think so. Nice thread here on software engineers, but also mentioning that magic phrase, network effect, which will continue to exist. This is key. Who else is talking about network effect in the agent space? This is my background, like gig marketplace, rideshare stuff, like thinking about network effect. I think about this a lot. And like how do you bring network effect into agents? Well, we think the agent-centric web will have its own meta network effect, rewarding those who make the web traversable to agents, connected into one market, punishing non-participants in that interoperability, eroding the moats of today's companies in their walled gardens. We think a lot of current companies and startups playing yesterday's game, my combinator, vertical agents, will not survive that transition to the agentic web. How are you going to fend off the agents of everyone else in the world pooling their like dragon ball z freaking spirit energy behind the bitcoinized open agents we're coming after all of that business oh this vc wants to back this vertical agent company don't attack it
