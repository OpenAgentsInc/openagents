Good morning. I wanted to share with you the results of our first ever agent that ran overnight. I came up with some interesting stuff just thinking about what's possible with the Cloudflare Agents SDK. Oh, it's still going. So I just want to show you kind of what I did here. So the idea here is we want to take the agentic chat here that works really well for my day-to-day development. You can kind of see an example I just tweeted yesterday of what's possible with this, where we're combining DeepSeek R1 and Sonnet 3.5 to think deeply about things and then come up with code and just coming up with code that I just never would have come up with on my own. But to just start minimizing my involvement even in this so that instead of needing to sit at the chat UI, I want agents doing this kind of thing overnight. Give it a feature request before I go to bed or three feature requests or 10 feature requests or have an agent give a feature request and then wake up in the morning and wake up to a bunch of PRs. That's the goal.

So we're using the new Cloudflare Agents SDK, which is really good. And I just want to show you kind of like what I did here and read you the final results because it's pretty entertaining. So I just started by saying I kind of hacked it to add the tool support, same thing we have in our current open agents interface. So I said on our current repo, read the readme and the docs. so I just had the read me BS summary of the Cloudflare agent SDK, core components features usage and then the most recent work log typescript fixes, get a token the stuff that's enabling this, the stuff that I added to the Cloudflare agent starter and for those who don't know I'm using the agent starter it mostly just this plus tool use And then I gave it the tool to be able to think. So it's get a file, view folder, and then it's got the scheduling stuff that it started with, and then think tool. I'm basically just, yeah, I'm just saying, you're a thinking assistant focused on deep analysis and reasoning. Each time you're called, build upon and extend previous concepts. Rather than repeating the earlier observations, view each prompt as part of an evolving conversation where you should introduce new angles, deeper insights, or connections that weren't apparent before. When analyzing conversation history, notice emerging patterns, shifts in focus, or potential future directions. That's basically it. And then I am having DeepSeek R1 do that thinking. And OpenAI 4.0 handles the scheduling.

Okay, let's see what it's coming up with. So the most recent one that I pulled is probably one or two more since then, but a representative example. Oh, and then the readme of the project, which is, yeah, that's just the Cloudflare agents. So I said, now use the think tool to reflect on the above. It starts by just kind of reflecting on the architecture, distribute active model, RBC system, blah, blah, blah. And then I say, please schedule a job so every 15 minutes you call a think tool reflecting on the above with an eye toward exploring future directions for expansion. This is just a glorified cron job. I mean, these are all Cron jobs, but it lives in their Cloudflare durable object with persistent memory and database and this kind of thing. And so it'll be easy to spin up like a whole bunch of these for users like you.

So if I go like halfway down, it's starting to think about biohybrid agent systems integrating synthetic biological components. What the? I going to copy this whole thing just to see how it evolved But I just wanted to read you the what i came up with um that i woke up to let read it together the scheduled reflection on integrating adaptive swarm intelligence for distributed problem solving in dynamic environments has been completed here are the insights and proposed strategies one swarm intelligence architecture core components a requirement decentralized coordination implementation peer-to-peer agent discovery via durable object handles and web socket pub sub channels yep integration with the sdk extend agent base with swarm.join topic and swarm.broadcast dynamic task allocation market-based bidding protocol gossip sub for taxes nice new swarm scheduler replacing cron powered by token incentivized bitcoin incentivized agent participation collective decision making Federated Byzantine Agreement layered with ZK Stark proofs. Consensus tool requiring 51% swarm approval for critical actions, ET replication. Adaptive learning. Embedded tiny ML models trained on swarm-wide state changes. Store model weights in SQLite. Sync via CRDTs for real-time swarm knowledge sharing. Sounds cool. Sounds doable, I guess, with that tech.

Biohybrid swarm enhancements digital pheromones class pheromone map extends agent tool insert into pheromones swarm dna constraints crisper encoded replication limits using synthetic biology okay What the fuck? Security and governance. Swarm on. Nums. Nothing on my sleeve. Addresses for agent identities. Agent ID is Blake3, public key. Hierarchical consensus. Leave no consensus. Challenge assignment. Shard consensus. Rude consensus. Ethical compliance. Adversarial tests. Chaos monkey style tool to simulate Byzantine slash poison agents. Some of this stuff, it'll be interesting to see in the history, how these ideas evolved, and what the hell is this.

But I am gonna after this pass this to a new model and just ask it to kind of explain stuff better Developer toolkit Disaster response swarm auto scheduling Quake response swarm Min agents, 50. Resource allocation and colony. Consensus protocol, fault tolerance, constraints. Max energy use. Ethical priority. Human life, historical preservation. Oh no. It's funny how agents have no confidence their ability to ship code quickly oh yeah 2025 q3 and then q1 we're not gonna be doing quarters people we're gonna be doing we're gonna be doing overnight code sessions release alpha swarm sdk with simulation sandbox support less than a thousand agents at 10 ms latency do that that's like a that's like a project for a day integrate bio pheromone system and quantum safe identity. Launch autonomous swarm reorganization protocol. Synergies across stack.

Yeah, so I may either what comes to mind is just like removing some of the bio CRISPR stuff. Or go make friends with that John Cui He guy. Gotta make some memes. Spiking neural networks process cluster sensor data. Interstellar governance. Lightweight FBFT consensus suitable for light-year latency environments. Future challenges. Information overload. Implement diffusion LM-based data summarization to compress cluster communication. Dynamic openness. Balance permissionless cluster participation with zero-chose auditing. Energy ethical imbalance. Introduce satellite remote sensing for dynamic bonus allegation mechanisms. Conclusion. This evolution transformed the chat agent starter kit into a distributed autonomous neural network capable of self-organizing intelligence in disaster response, interstellar resource coordination, and more. Next steps could focus on developer toolchain implementation or deepening biochemical constraint modules. Let me know how you'd like to proceed. How should we proceed, everybody? How will you proceed? That's it.
