Are you tired of MCP yet? Hopefully not. So you're looking at the newest MCP client, our forthcoming desktop app called Coder, connecting to a remote MCP server that we just pushed live, available to everyone. We're going to talk through what this is, why it matters, how it factors into our MCP store, and other cool roadmap items.


So Cloudflare, a gentleman here, says, remote MCP servers are going to change the internet, not just for developers, but for people using AI in daily life. So developers have heavily, what is this? Developers have heavily used MCP servers locally, something that's kind of like an adjunct to your editor. Cool, nice. It requires like cloning stuff down and doing stuff locally. But remote, that's just cloud infrastructure. It lives there and it's easy to consume it from any number of services such that you, as a non-technical person, maybe you are, maybe you aren't, won't need to set it up locally and run it.


The beauty of this is that instead of there being hundreds of different servers for different things, there can be a marketplace of things that are online and with money attached. So, hey, I'll pay for the best server that does the best algorithm for coding, whatever that looks like. Basically, remote MCP servers enable what we want to do with a marketplace, making all of the absolute best technology algorithms, AI integrations available in one marketplace built on open protocols.


If you're just tuning in, I recommend you watch our episode 150 where you can learn more about the philosophy of what we're doing here and why we're building on open protocols and blah, blah, blah. I don't want to recap everything here, but let's get to the meat of it. So we have a remote GitHub server here, and all we did was take the official one, like the reference implementation, from the official model context protocol repo, where they have here all of these different API endpoints.


And why this matters is you know the success that we've had with the open agents dashboard which has largely been kind of focused at developers because it's had this deep get up integration I've done 80% of my coding through this directly to the github API and this is these are tools that I wrote the integrations for just wrappers around the github API very simple and that's I also got grep that a local server microservice that I wrote and then fire crawl for a script web page But I using 18 tools because these are the ones that I like personally vetted But I wish that I could like click click click to extend this to also do things like connect to a Google Cloud, connect to local servers, maybe like a remote bash cell that can run lints on my code base.


I'd love to be able to extend this further. And I've got like a long list of stuff that I want to see and some of the things that I initially was thinking like, okay, I'll build this and this and this and this. But really, I should not be building any of this. No one team should be building like the integrations. They should be things that anyone can build and put online and then have that be consumable by any number of people. And you can attach conditions like payment and stuff optionally. We like that.


So the big news today was that open ai is uh adding support for mcp which is a big deal because mcp came out of anthropic their big competitor um you know i've given anthropic a lot of shit for various safetyist regulatory capture bullshit but mcp as a creation of this open protocol is like so amazing we've done a number of videos on this first one back in december um we're definitely wanting to use this but we've wanted really that remote piece and CloudFlare has definitively solved that for us but anyway the point here everything is converging on neutral open protocols the sooner you adopt the more durable your product wealth and business so yeah let's see who who uses these the most and best man I've just so much to say about that but I'm let's just keep going


Let's keep going. Okay, so we have this now working in our desktop app. And what's cool is that you will be able to test this yourself. So if you go to the CloudFlare test a remote MCP server, you'll see kind of these basic instructions for using the MCP inspector package, which you can also read about on the official MCP docs somewhere here. Inspector. Okay, so basically you can run this, and we're going to do that right now. It's just like a nice UI for experimenting with tools.


So let me show you my code base. Yeah, we're still using Cursor some, but we'll be replacing that pretty soon. Okay, MCP server, let's do this. No, I'm not going to do that. I'm going to run my script, actually, because I don't want to have to copy-paste it. But that's the script. I'm going to run urinspector. So npx at model context protocol slash inspector. And I already have it running I guess because. Alright so there's inspector. And then I have here a local version of my MCP server.


All of this is open source. The code for the MCP server that you will be demoing is in the app slash MCP GitHub server folder of our newly dusted off and refurbished repo here OpenAgence slash OpenAgence apps and MCP GitHub server Okay So with the inspector, I can open this up and I've got a little thing that lets me connect to different URLs. Well, hey, let's just connect it. So we're connected. And right now you can kind of, if you go to that root URL in the browser, we just put a little page there like, hey, this works, but test it via the inspector by connecting to this.


And then that is the server sent events, the transport for remote. Okay, no authentication right now. list tools. So this shows all of the tools. And these are just the same tools that were in that official reference implementation of the GitHub. But, I mean, this is even more tools. You can kind of compare this to what I have at OpenAgents. Like, I've got like 15 tools. Fork repo, push files, everything that you would want to do. You can click on any of them.


And so I showed you the get file contents one in the Electron app. because that is the only one that I kind of hard-coded support for in ours. But you can go here and do anything. And so what you can do is open your own local inspector, connect to our MCP server, or, importantly, you can run this and deploy this yourself by forking our repo, So inspect the code to your heart's content and then deploy this with Wrangler to your own Cloudflare account. It should cost approximately $0. And then you can put your own stuff in here.


I did also add support for optionally passing in a GitHub token. I don't want to demo that because I don't want anyone using that other than me yet because I just don't want people sending tokens to our servers. conceivably we can make sure eventually that like nothing's being logged and so i'm just like don't want to do that uh i'll be using it because i trust myself but the point is you shouldn't have to trust the software that you're running uh you should be able to always point and click and fork and deploy your own or you know um use the the service from someone else who you trust


Okay, so let's try this a little bit. First let's list the issues. OpenAgents Inc, OpenAgents, I think or hope the rest of this is optional let see what happens Success oh yeah there no does this default to open issues There no open issues Direction. What the hell does direction mean? What else can we do here? Get issue. Let's do get issue. Open agents... Oh, open agents, ink, open agents. Let's get issue... I think it was 781. one run tool success and let's do they let me easily copy this and let's just take a quick peek at it if we go to JSON pretty pretty here pretty fine dude did Do, do, do.


Yeah. Title, wallet, demo. Okay. There you get all the information. And then what's cool is that, because it returns the full GitHub blob, the agent can then use any of these things if it wants to pull comments or events or any of these other things it can smartly traverse throughout these things. Okay, so that's basic handshake we have between both the inspector and our desktop app connecting to a remote MCP server.


What is gonna be super cool is I guess in the next video, we'll show you what this looks like in a chat interface where you could test a version of this now, but not with the MCP, which is the idea of like using GitHub integrations in the context of a chat on openagents.com. but to be able to do this now in kind of like an extensible client, where then we can be connecting to any number of MCP servers that are out there in the world, remote MCP servers.


There probably aren't very many right now. There's lots of MCP servers that are out there, but every directory that's out there right now is like here's one. Yoko's here. Watch this. So there's a bunch of people who are making these kind of read-only directories or these things where they're the ones that are local. It's a registry, but it's stuff that you're supposed to pull down and use yourself. This doesn't do you probably any good, but if it's in a registry where people then can build agents that you can then just consume, click here to authenticate your that account, that account, that account, and now this agent has all of that context and tools to do cool stuff, that in a marketplace with network effect, we think that is the name of the game next.


So, we think it's a race to network effect and we intend to win it. But MCP is what we're going to be building on. Alright, more soon. See ya.
