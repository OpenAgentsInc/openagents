Here is the full transcription of the video:

**00:00**
**Speaker:** Hey folks, if you liked OpenClaw, you're gonna love Autopilot. We want it to be the easiest personal agent to set up, and then also the most powerful because it gets upgraded automatically over time. So, I'm gonna click on OpenAgents.com, "Start for Free."

**00:13**
**Speaker:** Hey look, I'm in the chat. That was easy. Okay, "Enter your email address to begin." Let's set up a new account. Basically, instead of a big, hairy signup process where you have to wait ten minutes for a computer, you know, you just connect your email and then you have an account.

**00:29**
**Speaker:** Now, all of these messages to Autopilot are going to be saved. So it's gonna remember it. It's one long-running conversation. The setup process here... "What shall I call you?"... is going to be modeled off of OpenClaw. Pretty similar thing, it's gonna create its own identity doc and you can kind of customize it and stuff.

**00:46**
**Speaker:** "What should you call me?" Auto. So what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna flip over to my personal, real account and show you how I've set mine up. So right now this is rather basic. And you can see that whenever you ask for it to do something that it cannot currently do...

**01:08**
**Speaker:** I said, "I need to connect my Github account so you can read my repos. Can you do that?" It does a tool request called "Record Feature Request." "I can't do that yet. The Autopilot network is evolving rapidly based on user requests. Check back soon. We can email you when that capability launches. Is there anything else I can help with in the meantime?"

**01:25**
**Speaker:** So it's like a basic chatbot, and it's gonna record when you ask it to do something that it can't do. Now, tomorrow or so, I'm gonna do a new video showing off, here's the Github integration. Now, if ten of you are in here and you're like, "Please connect to my, you know, Bitcoin LN Markets account," or "Connect to my Gmail," or "Connect to my whatever it is," you'll find that maybe the next *day* that feature gets added.

**01:50**
**Speaker:** And it gets added for everyone, for all Autopilots. So this is both learning about *your* preferences and improving based on what you want, and also at the network level. So the big picture here is, we'll go into more details on the like underlying architecture... this is also like, I think, the first chatbot interface *ever* to use DSPy as first-class primitives that are...

**02:13**
**Speaker:** DSPy in effect... okay, we wrote DSPy in effect TypeScript framework... with independently discoverable signatures, monetized with Bitcoin, connected to an open protocol marketplace. Basically, this is gonna evolve over time and people are gonna get paid in Bitcoin for skills that they create. Whenever you're paying your Autopilot, they'll get a tiny piece of that.

**02:34**
**Speaker:** Okay, more soon. For now, go to OpenAgents.com, you can set up your account and say what you want to do to Autopilot. And then stay tuned over the next few days and let's watch how this upgrades over time. See ya soon.
