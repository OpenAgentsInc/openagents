# Solver Agent Tool Integration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for integrating tools with the Anthropic API in the Solver agent using Effect for functional programming.

## Implementation

1. **Tool Definition and Formatting**
   - We define and format tools according to Anthropic's API requirements
   - Each tool has a name, description, and input schema
   - Tools are formatted as JSON objects that can be passed directly to the API

2. **Tool Execution**
   - We've implemented `executeToolByName` to handle tool execution
   - This bridges between Anthropic's tool call format and our existing Vercel AI SDK tools
   - Error handling is implemented for tool execution failures

3. **API Integration**
   - In `chat.ts`, we pass the formatted tools to the Anthropic API call
   - We handle tool calls in the response by executing each tool and collecting results
   - Tool results are formatted and can be sent back to the API if needed

4. **State Management**
   - Tools can access agent state through the AsyncLocalStorage context
   - This allows tools to read and update shared state, like issue context or GitHub token

## Key Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: This implementation allows tools to be easily added or modified
2. **Type Safety**: We maintain TypeScript type checking throughout the implementation
3. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for API calls and tool execution
4. **Performance**: Efficient execution without unnecessary abstractions

## Future Improvements

1. **Advanced Context**: Implement more robust context management for tools
2. **Tool Result Handling**: Enhance the handling of tool results in multi-turn conversations
3. **Streaming**: Add support for streaming responses when tools are used

## Testing

To test this implementation:
1. Build and deploy the agent
2. Set context with an issue
3. Set GitHub token 
4. Send a message that should trigger tool use
5. Verify that tools are called correctly and results are returned
