# Solver Agent Fixes - Technical Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive fixes implemented for the Solver Agent in the OpenAgents project to address several critical issues:

1. Context persistence problems where agent state was being lost between requests
2. System prompt generation issues where issue context wasn't being properly included
3. Message display problems where inference responses weren't appearing in the UI
4. Error handling improvements to prevent premature error messages

## Problem Diagnosis

### Context Persistence Issue

The primary issue was that while the Solver agent would receive context data (issue, project, team) through WebSocket messages, this state wasn't properly persisting between requests. This was evident when:

1. The agent would successfully set context data when a `set_context` message was received
2. Later message handlers (particularly for `shared_infer`) would show the state as empty
3. System prompts were being generated without the issue context, causing the agent to respond as if it had no issue to work on

### Message Display Problems

Responses from the agent were not appearing in the UI because:

1. The agent's message history wasn't being properly updated on the server
2. The client wasn't correctly handling asynchronous responses from the WebSocket
3. Error messages were being displayed prematurely before the actual response arrived

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Enhanced State Management in Solver Agent

**File:** `packages/agents/src/agents/solver/index.ts`

- **Improved setState Method**:
  ```typescript
  override async setState(partialState: Partial<SolverState>) {
    // Create a complete state object that includes all required properties
    const fullState: SolverState = { ...this.state };
    
    // Apply updates with deep cloning to avoid reference issues
    Object.keys(partialState).forEach(key => {
      (fullState as any)[key] = typeof value === 'object' && value !== null
        ? JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(value))
        : value;
    });
    
    // Ensure messages array always exists (required by type)
    if (!fullState.messages) {
      fullState.messages = [];
    }
    
    await super.setState(fullState);
  }
  ```

- **Enhanced System Prompt Generation**:
  ```typescript
  getSystemPrompt() {
    // Create a snapshot of the current state
    const stateSnapshot: SolverState = {
      ...this.state,
      currentIssue: this.state.currentIssue ? { ...this.state.currentIssue } : undefined,
      // ... other properties
    };
    
    // Generate and validate the system prompt
    const systemPrompt = getSolverSystemPrompt({ state: stateSnapshot });
    
    // Log key sections to verify content
    console.log("SYSTEM PROMPT: Key sections check:", {
      hasIssueSection: systemPrompt.includes("CURRENT ISSUE"),
      hasProjectSection: systemPrompt.includes("PROJECT CONTEXT"),
      hasTeamSection: systemPrompt.includes("TEAM CONTEXT")
    });
    
    return systemPrompt;
  }
  ```

- **Improved Message Handlers**:
  - Enhanced the `set_context` handler with better validation and logging
  - Updated the `shared_infer` handler to check for missing context and restore it when needed
  - Added automated message history updates on the server side

### 2. Fixed Client-Side Components

**Files:** 
- `apps/website/app/components/agent/solver-connector.tsx`
- `apps/website/app/components/agent/solver-controls.tsx`

- **Improved Inference Handling**:
  ```typescript
  // Send the inference request with context data
  const response = await agent.sendRawMessage({
    type: "shared_infer",
    requestId: generateId(),
    params: {
      model: "@cf/meta/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct",
      messages: allMessages,
      system: systemPrompt,
      temperature: 0.7,
      max_tokens: 1000
    },
    // Include context in case agent needs to restore it
    context: {
      issue: formattedIssue,
      project: formattedProject,
      team: formattedTeam
    }
  });
  
  // Don't show an error immediately - wait for async response
  if (!result || !result.id || !result.content) {
    console.log("Waiting for async inference result via WebSocket...");
    return;
  }
  ```

- **Proper Message Display**:
  - Removed premature error messages when responses aren't immediately available
  - Added better handling of WebSocket response events
  - Enhanced logging for debugging message flow

### 3. Server-Side Response Handling

**File:** `packages/agents/src/agents/solver/index.ts`

- **Automatic Message History Updates**:
  ```typescript
  // Add the response to our messages array if it's not already there
  const existingMessageIndex = this.state.messages.findIndex(msg => msg.id === result.id);
  if (existingMessageIndex === -1 && result.id && result.content) {
    // Format the assistant message with proper typing
    const assistantMessage: any = {
      id: result.id,
      role: 'assistant' as const,
      content: result.content,
      parts: [{
        type: 'text' as const,
        text: result.content
      }]
    };
    
    // Update the messages array in state
    await this.setState({
      messages: [...this.state.messages, assistantMessage]
    });
    
    console.log("Messages array updated, now contains", this.state.messages.length, "messages");
  }
  ```

### 4. Parent Component Context Setting

**File:** `apps/website/app/routes/issues/$id.tsx`

- **Improved Context Management**:
  ```typescript
  useEffect(() => {
    // Check if context needs to be set or updated
    const needsContext = agent.connectionStatus === 'connected' && (
      !agent.state?.currentIssue || 
      !agent.state?.currentProject || 
      !agent.state?.currentTeam ||
      (agent.state.currentIssue && agent.state.currentIssue.id !== issue.id)
    );
    
    if (needsContext) {
      // Format and send context data
      const contextMessage = {
        type: "set_context",
        issue: formattedIssue,
        project: formattedProject,
        team: formattedTeam,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
      };
      
      agent.sendRawMessage(contextMessage);
      
      // Verify context was set correctly after delay
      setTimeout(async () => {
        const systemPrompt = await agent.getSystemPrompt();
        console.log("Context verification:", {
          hasIssue: systemPrompt.includes("CURRENT ISSUE"),
          hasProject: systemPrompt.includes("PROJECT CONTEXT"),
          issueMatches: systemPrompt.includes(issue.title)
        });
      }, 1000);
    }
  }, [agent.connectionStatus, agent.state, issue]);
  ```

## Key Lessons and Best Practices

1. **State Management in Cloudflare Agents**:
   - Cloudflare Agents have built-in state persistence using SQLite
   - Use the `setState` method to ensure proper persistence
   - Always create deep copies when storing complex objects
   - Ensure required properties are never undefined to prevent type errors

2. **WebSocket Communication**:
   - WebSocket responses may be asynchronous and non-sequential
   - Don't assume responses arrive in the same order as requests
   - Always include a requestId to match responses to requests
   - Include context data in critical messages to allow recovery

3. **UI Message Display**:
   - Manage local UI state separately from server state
   - For critical UI updates, ensure both client and server maintain consistent state
   - Implement proper error handling for network issues
   - Avoid premature error messages for asynchronous operations

4. **TypeScript and Type Safety**:
   - Use `as const` assertions for literal types in message formatting
   - Ensure proper typing for state properties
   - Use TypeScript to catch potential state inconsistencies early

## Debugging Techniques

The following debugging strategies were implemented:

1. **Enhanced Logging**:
   - Added state snapshots before and after operations
   - Logged system prompt content and key sections
   - Added correlation IDs for tracing messages

2. **State Verification**:
   - Added checks to validate state was correctly updated
   - Implemented timeout-based verification after state changes
   - Added context validation in system prompts

3. **Error Recovery**:
   - Added fallback mechanisms for missing state
   - Implemented context restoration from message parameters
   - Added defensive coding to prevent cascading failures

## Conclusion

The implemented fixes establish a robust mechanism for persisting agent state, ensuring proper context in system prompts, and correctly displaying agent responses in the UI. The comprehensive approach addresses not just the symptoms but the root causes of the issues.

This work demonstrates the importance of understanding the underlying architecture of stateful WebSocket-based applications and the specific requirements of the Cloudflare Agents platform.
