/**
 * Capacity-aware dispatch account selection (#8389; depends on the
 * `fleet.reportAccountState` capacity fields added in #8302's follow-up —
 * see `packages/khala-sync-server/src/fleet-mutators.ts`).
 *
 * Pure selector: given the `fleet_account` post-images currently projected
 * for a fleet run scope, pick the single best account for the NEXT
 * `runtime.startTurn` dispatch. No I/O, no scope/ownership concerns — those
 * stay with the caller.
 *
 * Lives in `@openagentsinc/khala-sync` (not `khala-sync-server`, where it
 * was originally written) because it is pure schema-level logic with zero
 * I/O and now has a real caller that must not depend on
 * `khala-sync-server`: the published, npm-distributed `apps/pylon` runtime
 * dispatch consumer
 * (`apps/pylon/src/orchestration/runtime-intent-enforcement.ts`, #8388).
 * `khala-sync-server` is `"private": true` (it depends on the `postgres`
 * driver and Worker-only mutator/projection logic) and is never published
 * to npm, so a published package like Pylon cannot take a `workspace:*`
 * dependency on it — see `apps/pylon/docs/npm-publishing-runbook.md`'s
 * "leaf dependencies first" publish order, which requires every
 * `workspace:*` dependency of Pylon to itself be a publishable
 * (`"private": false`) leaf package. `@openagentsinc/khala-sync` already
 * is one and is already a normal Pylon dependency, so this is the correct
 * shared home for both the server and the Pylon-side consumer.
 *
 * ELIGIBILITY: an account is a dispatch candidate only when ALL hold:
 *   - `readiness === "ready"` (a `cooldown`/`unavailable`/`unknown` account
 *     is excluded even if it still reports leftover `capacityAvailable` —
 *     readiness is the authoritative signal; capacity numbers can lag it).
 *   - `capacityAvailable !== undefined && capacityAvailable > 0`. Missing
 *     capacity is NOT treated as "assume available" (that would dispatch
 *     into unknown-capacity accounts) or as zero-is-fine (same failure
 *     mode as `undefined` — both mean "we don't know this account has a
 *     free slot").
 *   - `options.provider`, when given, equals the account's `provider`
 *     (an account with no reported `provider` never matches a set filter).
 *
 * RANKING among eligible accounts:
 *   1. Highest `capacityAvailable` wins.
 *   2. Tie-break: lowest `capacityBusy + capacityQueued` (least loaded).
 *      Missing `capacityBusy`/`capacityQueued` count as 0 for this sum —
 *      eligibility already required a known `capacityAvailable`, so a
 *      missing load field reads as "no reported load" rather than
 *      "unknown", unlike the eligibility gate above.
 *   3. Tie-break: `accountRefHash` lexicographic ascending, for a fully
 *      deterministic order.
 *
 * ROUND-ROBIN WITHIN A FULL TIE: when the top-ranked group after all three
 * tie-breaks still contains more than one account (i.e. they are
 * indistinguishable — same capacity, same load, and the caller is telling
 * us which hash it dispatched to last), prefer a DIFFERENT member of that
 * tied group over repeating `lastUsedAccountRefHash`, cycling through the
 * group in `accountRefHash` order. This is the "round-robin by available
 * capacity" behavior named in the issue title: capacity naturally breaks
 * most ties across real dispatches (`capacityBusy` changes after each
 * turn), and this covers the residual case where multiple otherwise-equal
 * accounts would otherwise always resolve to the same lowest hash.
 *
 * Returns `undefined` when no account is eligible (empty list, or every
 * account is at zero/unknown capacity or not ready) — callers must not
 * fabricate a fallback account.
