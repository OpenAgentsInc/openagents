# Integrating Bun into a pnpm monorepo

The integration of Bun into a pnpm monorepo requires a strategic hybrid approach that leverages both tools' strengths rather than attempting a direct replacement, as significant architectural differences present compatibility challenges that prevent seamless interoperability.

## Fundamental architectural differences

Bun and pnpm take fundamentally different approaches to dependency management that impact their compatibility. While pnpm uses a sophisticated content-addressable global store with hard links and complex symlink structures to deduplicate packages, Bun prioritizes speed through hardlinks on Linux/Windows and clonefile on macOS, creating a standard node_modules structure that prioritizes tooling compatibility over disk space optimization.

The lockfile incompatibility poses a major challenge - pnpm uses human-readable `pnpm-lock.yaml` while Bun historically used a binary `bun.lockb` format, though version 1.2+ introduces text-based `bun.lock` files. **No direct migration path exists between these lockfile formats**, requiring manual regeneration when switching tools. Additionally, while both support workspace protocols, Bun's implementation is simpler, supporting primarily `workspace:*` compared to pnpm's comprehensive `workspace:*`, `workspace:^`, and `workspace:~` variants.

## Installation command strategy

For dependency management in a pnpm monorepo, **continuing to use `pnpm install` is strongly recommended** rather than switching to `bun install`. This maintains the sophisticated workspace features, dependency isolation, and proven stability that pnpm provides. Attempting to use `bun install` in an existing pnpm workspace often results in errors like "Workspace name already exists" due to fundamental incompatibilities in how the tools handle workspace structures.

The optimal approach involves using pnpm for all package management operations while leveraging Bun selectively for its runtime and bundling capabilities. This hybrid strategy provides:

```bash
# Use pnpm for dependency management
pnpm install                          # Install all dependencies
pnpm --filter @company/api add lodash # Add dependencies to specific workspaces
pnpm --filter "...@company/shared" run build # Build with dependency graph awareness

# Use Bun for runtime execution
bun run dev                          # Fast script execution
bun test                            # Rapid test running
bun run --hot src/server.ts         # Hot reload development
```

## Configuration for hybrid usage

Successfully using both tools requires careful configuration of multiple files:

```toml
# bunfig.toml - Configure Bun for pnpm compatibility
[install]
exact = false
linkWorkspacePackages = false  # Don't override pnpm's linking
saveTextLockfile = true       # Use text-based lockfile for Git

[install.cache]
dir = "~/.bun/install/cache"

[run]
shell = "system"  # Compatibility with existing scripts
```

The workspace structure should be defined in both `package.json` and `pnpm-workspace.yaml`:

```json
// package.json
{
  "name": "my-monorepo",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": ["packages/*", "apps/*"],
  "packageManager": "pnpm@9.0.0"
}
```

```yaml
# pnpm-workspace.yaml
packages:
  - 'packages/*'
  - 'apps/*'
  - '!**/test/**'
```

## Best practices for runtime and bundler usage

Bun excels as a runtime and bundler within pnpm-managed monorepos. Individual packages can leverage Bun's performance while maintaining pnpm's workspace management:

```javascript
// packages/api/build.js - Bun bundler configuration
await Bun.build({
  entrypoints: ['./src/index.ts'],
  outdir: './dist',
  target: 'bun',
  external: ['@monorepo/shared'], // Respect workspace dependencies
  minify: true,
  sourcemap: 'linked'
});
```

For development workflows, Bun's hot reload and TypeScript support provide significant benefits:

```json
// Individual package scripts using Bun runtime
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "bun run --hot src/index.ts",
    "build": "bun run build.js",
    "test": "bun test"
  }
}
```

## Key compatibility considerations

Several critical issues affect Bun-pnpm integration:

1. **Native dependencies**: Bun blocks postinstall scripts by default, requiring explicit trust configuration for packages like Sharp or Puppeteer
2. **Performance variations**: While Bun claims 8x faster installs, real-world performance varies significantly - simple projects see 3-4x improvements, but complex projects with native dependencies can be 3x slower
3. **Windows support**: Bun has limited Windows support, making WSL necessary for Windows development teams
4. **Monorepo features**: Bun lacks pnpm's advanced filtering syntax and sophisticated peer dependency resolution

## Recommended integration patterns

### Pattern 1: Runtime-only integration (Most stable)
Use pnpm for all dependency management while leveraging Bun exclusively for runtime execution and testing. This approach maintains full pnpm workspace functionality while gaining Bun's performance benefits for script execution.

### Pattern 2: Selective package migration
Migrate simple packages without native dependencies to use Bun for both installation and runtime, while keeping complex packages on pnpm. This requires maintaining both lockfiles and careful CI/CD configuration.

### Pattern 3: Build-time optimization
Use pnpm for development dependency management and Bun's bundler for production builds, leveraging Bun's fast bundling while maintaining development stability.

## Real-world implementation examples

Several projects successfully implement hybrid approaches. The most common pattern involves maintaining pnpm's workspace structure while using Bun for specific performance-critical operations:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions CI/CD configuration
- name: Setup pnpm
  uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
  with:
    version: 9.0.0
- name: Setup Bun
  uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1
  with:
    bun-version: 1.2.0
- run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
- run: bun test
- run: bun run build
```

## Migration strategy recommendations

For existing pnpm monorepos, a phased approach minimizes risk:

**Phase 1**: Introduce Bun for development scripts and testing while maintaining pnpm for dependency management
**Phase 2**: Migrate simple packages without native dependencies to use Bun runtime
**Phase 3**: Evaluate full migration only after extensive testing and team training

Full migration to Bun workspaces should only be considered for teams with simple dependency trees and comprehensive testing capabilities, as Bun's monorepo support remains less mature than pnpm's battle-tested implementation.

## Conclusion

The optimal approach for integrating Bun into a pnpm monorepo involves leveraging each tool's strengths: **pnpm's mature workspace management and dependency resolution alongside Bun's superior runtime performance and bundling speed**. Rather than attempting a complete replacement, teams should adopt a hybrid strategy that uses pnpm for package management (`pnpm install`) while selectively employing Bun for runtime execution, testing, and bundling where its performance benefits are most impactful. As Bun's monorepo capabilities continue to evolve rapidly, regular reevaluation of this integration strategy is recommended to take advantage of new features and improved compatibility.
