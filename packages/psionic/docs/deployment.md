# Bun goes to production: Deployment strategies for Psionic applications

Bun's emergence as a high-performance JavaScript runtime has opened new possibilities for deploying modern web applications. For Psionic applications requiring WebSocket support, hypermedia serving, and Effect-TS compatibility, the deployment landscape offers several compelling options. **Railway emerges as the clear winner for small-to-medium scale deployments**, combining native Bun support, excellent developer experience, and transparent pricing starting at $5/month.

The runtime, built with Zig and powered by JavaScriptCore, delivers impressive performance gains: 377% faster HTTP serving, 29x faster package installation, and 10x better file I/O compared to Node.js. However, these advantages come with trade-offs – Bun applications typically consume 25-50% more memory and show 2.6x slower cold starts in serverless environments. For indie developers and small teams building hypermedia applications, understanding these nuances is crucial for successful production deployments.

## Native hosting platforms lead the charge

Railway stands out with its seamless Bun integration through Nixpacks, offering automatic detection via `bun.lockb` files and zero-configuration deployments. The platform provides full WebSocket support essential for Psionic's relay architecture, built-in database integration, and real-time collaboration features. At $5/month plus usage-based pricing, it offers the best balance of features and cost for small teams.

Render provides another strong option with native Bun runtime support, eliminating the need for Docker containers. Their $7/month starter plan includes a global CDN, managed PostgreSQL/Redis integration, and automatic SSL certificates. Fly.io rounds out the top tier with excellent WebSocket performance and multi-region deployment capabilities, though it requires more technical expertise and offers usage-based pricing that can be unpredictable.

Notably, **Vercel and Netlify do not support Bun as a runtime**, only as a package manager during builds. This limitation makes them unsuitable for Psionic applications despite their popularity in the JavaScript ecosystem.

## Docker strategies enable flexible deployment

Containerization remains crucial for consistent deployments across environments. The official `oven/bun` Docker images provide multiple variants, with production deployments benefiting from multi-stage builds that can reduce image sizes by 35%. A production-ready Dockerfile for Psionic applications should leverage the slim variant and run as a non-root user:

```dockerfile
FROM oven/bun:1-slim AS production
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=build /app/node_modules ./node_modules
USER bun
CMD ["bun", "run", "dist/index.js"]
```

For maximum security and minimal attack surface, teams can compile Bun applications to standalone binaries and deploy them in distroless containers. This approach, while requiring more setup, provides the smallest possible production footprint.

## Edge and serverless present challenges

The serverless ecosystem for Bun remains immature. **Cloudflare Workers and Deno Deploy do not support Bun runtime**, limiting edge deployment options. AWS Lambda requires a custom runtime layer with significant cold start penalties – 750ms compared to Node.js's 290ms. This 2.6x slower cold start makes serverless Bun unsuitable for latency-sensitive applications.

Railway Functions emerges as the only production-ready serverless option with native Bun support, providing access to Bun-specific APIs and TypeScript execution. For teams committed to serverless architecture, using Bun for development while deploying to Node.js-compatible platforms remains the pragmatic choice.

## Traditional VPS offers cost-effective control

For teams comfortable with server management, traditional VPS providers offer the most cost-effective deployments. Hetzner leads with €3.29/month for a capable instance with 20TB of included bandwidth. DigitalOcean and Linode provide similar offerings starting at $4-5/month. These deployments require manual Bun installation but offer complete control over the environment.

Process management through PM2 or systemd ensures application resilience, while reverse proxies like Caddy provide automatic HTTPS with minimal configuration. For a production setup, teams should implement:

- Systemd service files for automatic restarts
- Caddy reverse proxy with automatic SSL via Let's Encrypt
- Basic monitoring through systemd journals
- Automated backups to object storage

## Database and WebSocket infrastructure shines

Bun's built-in PostgreSQL support (`Bun.sql`) leverages JavaScriptCore internals for superior performance with automatic connection pooling and prepared statements. The native WebSocket implementation, built on uWebSockets, handles **700,000 messages per second** – 7x faster than Node.js alternatives. This performance advantage makes Bun particularly well-suited for Psionic's relay architecture.

The WebSocket server includes production-ready features like built-in pub/sub, per-connection context data, and backpressure management. For scaling beyond a single server, teams should implement sticky sessions at the load balancer level or integrate with Redis for cross-server communication.

## CI/CD and operations require specific considerations

GitHub Actions provides the smoothest CI/CD experience with the official `oven-sh/setup-bun` action. Build times improve by 30-60% compared to Node.js projects, translating to real cost savings on cloud compute. For monitoring, OpenTelemetry integration through the `bunotel` hook enables comprehensive application performance monitoring with existing APM tools.

SSL/TLS management follows standard practices, with Cloudflare's free tier providing an excellent starting point for small teams. The platform handles automatic certificate renewal and provides basic DDoS protection, crucial for production applications.

## Performance benchmarks reveal nuanced picture

While Bun excels at I/O operations with 52,000+ requests per second compared to Node.js's 13,254, it shows weaknesses in cryptographic operations (10x slower) and higher memory consumption. Production deployments should budget for 25-50% additional memory compared to equivalent Node.js applications.

Cost optimization strategies focus on leveraging Bun's strengths: faster CI/CD pipelines, reduced dependency installation time, and superior file I/O performance. For indie developers, these efficiency gains can offset the higher memory requirements, particularly when combined with cost-effective hosting options like Hetzner.

## Zero-downtime deployments ensure reliability

Blue-green deployments work seamlessly with Bun applications, whether using container orchestration or traditional server setups. The key lies in proper health check implementation and traffic routing. Bun's fast startup time aids quick deployments, though teams should implement proper warm-up procedures to mitigate cold start issues.

For growing applications, horizontal scaling through load balancers and container orchestration provides the most flexible growth path. Bun's `reusePort` option enables efficient connection distribution across multiple processes on the same server.

## Recommendations for Psionic developers

For small-to-medium scale Psionic applications, the optimal deployment stack combines:

1. **Railway** for managed hosting with native Bun support ($5/month base)
2. **Docker** multi-stage builds for consistent deployments
3. **Bun.sql** for PostgreSQL with built-in connection pooling
4. **Native WebSockets** with Redis pub/sub for multi-server scaling
5. **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD with 30-60% faster builds
6. **Cloudflare** free tier for SSL and basic CDN

Teams requiring more control should consider Hetzner VPS with Caddy reverse proxy, providing excellent value at €3.29/month. Avoid serverless deployments until the ecosystem matures, and steer clear of platforms without native Bun runtime support.

The Bun ecosystem continues evolving rapidly, with improved platform support and tooling emerging regularly. For Psionic applications leveraging hypermedia patterns and WebSocket communications, Bun's performance advantages in I/O operations and built-in features provide compelling benefits that outweigh its current limitations. By choosing appropriate deployment strategies and platforms, teams can successfully run Bun applications in production while maintaining reasonable costs and operational complexity.
