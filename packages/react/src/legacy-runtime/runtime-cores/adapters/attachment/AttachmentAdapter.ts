 * Interface for handling file attachments in the assistant runtime.

 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * const imageAdapter: AttachmentAdapter = {
 *   accept: "image/*",
 *
 *   async add({ file }) {
 *     return {
 *       id: generateId(),
 *       type: "image",
 *       name: file.name,
 *       file,
 *       status: { type: "uploading" }
 *     };
 *   },
 *
 *   async remove(attachment) {
 *     // Clean up resources
 *   },
 *
 *   async send(attachment) {
 *     const url = await uploadFile(attachment.file);
 *     return { ...attachment, url, status: { type: "complete" } };
 *   }
 * };
