# Storybook Deployment Success and Typed Component Issues

## Deployment Resolution

### The Mystery Solved
After numerous deployment attempts returning 404 errors, we discovered that **the deployment was actually successful all along**. The issue was a combination of:

1. **DNS Propagation Delay**: The custom domain `storybook.openagents.com` took time to propagate
2. **Different Routing Behavior**: The workers.dev URL (`https://openagents-storybook.openagents.workers.dev/`) still returns 404, but the custom domain works perfectly
3. **Cloudflare Custom Domain Magic**: Custom domains appear to have different routing/serving behavior than the default workers.dev domains

### Current Status
- ✅ **Custom Domain Working**: https://storybook.openagents.com/ is live and serving Storybook
- ❌ **Workers.dev URL Not Working**: https://openagents-storybook.openagents.workers.dev/ returns 404
- ✅ **All Assets Loading**: CSS, JS, fonts, and other static assets load correctly
- ✅ **HTML Stories Working**: Regular HTML component stories display properly
- ❌ **Typed Stories Broken**: Typed framework stories throw errors

### Working Configuration
The configuration that ultimately worked (in `packages/storybook/wrangler.jsonc`):
```jsonc
{
  "name": "openagents-storybook",
  "compatibility_date": "2025-06-14",
  "build": {
    "command": "pnpm build-storybook"
  },
  "assets": {
    "directory": "./storybook-static"
  },
  "routes": [
    {
      "pattern": "storybook.openagents.com",
      "custom_domain": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Typed Component Issue

### Error Details
When trying to view Typed component stories, we get:
```
Error: Expecting an HTML snippet or DOM node from the story: "Primary" of "Typed/Button". 
- Did you forget to return the HTML snippet from the story?
  at showError (/sb-preview/runtime.js:8285:85))
  at pi.L [as renderToScreen] (/assets/entry-preview-DImpdu69.js:4:281))
  at Object.renderToCanvas (/sb-preview/runtime.js:8258:30))
```

### Root Cause Analysis
The error indicates that Storybook's HTML renderer is expecting either:
1. An HTML string (e.g., `"<button>Click me</button>"`)
2. A DOM node/element

But our Typed stories are returning something else - likely Effect objects or Typed framework-specific structures.

### Investigation Needed
1. **Check Story Return Values**: The Typed stories are likely returning Effect/Typed objects instead of HTML
2. **Renderer Mismatch**: We're using `@storybook/html` but Typed components may need a custom renderer
3. **Conversion Missing**: We need to convert Typed components to HTML strings or DOM nodes

### Example of the Problem
Looking at `TypedButton.stories.ts`:
```typescript
export const Primary: Story = {
  args: {
    variant: "primary",
    children: "Click me"
  }
};
```

This story is using the `render` function defined earlier, which likely returns a Typed/Effect structure, not HTML.

## Next Steps

### To Fix Typed Components
1. **Add HTML Conversion**: Modify the render function to convert Typed components to HTML strings
2. **Custom Renderer**: Consider creating a custom Storybook renderer for Typed framework
3. **Effect Runtime**: Ensure Effect runtime is properly initialized and components are executed

### Potential Solutions
1. **Quick Fix**: Modify render functions to call `toString()` or similar on Typed components
2. **Proper Fix**: Implement a proper Typed-to-HTML converter that:
   - Runs Effect computations
   - Extracts the resulting HTML
   - Returns it in a format Storybook HTML expects

### Key Learning
The deployment issues were a red herring - the real challenge is making Typed framework components compatible with Storybook's HTML renderer expectations.
