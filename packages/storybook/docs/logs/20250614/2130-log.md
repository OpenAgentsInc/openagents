# Storybook Typed Framework Migration Log
Date: 2025-06-14 21:30
Agent: Claude

## Executive Summary
We successfully deployed Storybook to https://storybook.openagents.com/ but discovered that Typed components were not rendering. We've now migrated all stories to use @typed/storybook framework but are encountering "No render function available" errors.

## Current Status
- ✅ Storybook deployed and accessible at https://storybook.openagents.com/
- ✅ All stories converted from HTML to Typed framework
- ❌ Stories failing with "No render function available for storyId" error
- ❌ Need to properly configure @typed/storybook renderer

## What Was Done

### 1. Deployment Issue Resolution
- Discovered deployment was working all along - DNS just needed to propagate
- Custom domain works: https://storybook.openagents.com/
- Workers.dev URL doesn't work (returns 404) - this appears to be normal

### 2. Typed Framework Installation
```bash
pnpm add -D @typed/storybook
```

### 3. Configuration Updates

#### .storybook/main.js
```javascript
/** @type {import('@typed/storybook').StorybookConfig} */
const config = {
  stories: ["../stories/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|mjs|ts|tsx)"],
  addons: [
    "@storybook/addon-links",
    "@storybook/addon-essentials",
    "@storybook/addon-interactions"
  ],
  framework: {
    name: "@typed/storybook",
    options: {}
  },
  typescript: {
    check: false
  },
  docs: {
    autodocs: "tag"
  }
}
export default config
```

#### .storybook/preview.js
Updated to use `@typed/storybook` types.

### 4. Story Conversions
Converted all stories from HTML to Typed:
- Button.stories.ts
- Card.stories.ts
- TypedButton.stories.ts
- TypedCard.stories.ts
- CombinedButton.stories.ts

Example pattern:
```typescript
import type { Meta, StoryObj } from "@typed/storybook"
import { button } from "@typed/ui/hyperscript"
import type { Fx } from "@typed/fx/Fx"
import { RenderEvent } from "@typed/dom/RenderEvent"

const Component = (args: Args): Fx<RenderEvent, never, any> => {
  // Return Typed UI elements
}
```

## Current Error
```
No render function available for storyId 'typed-button--primary'
SB_PREVIEW_API_0014 (NoRenderFunctionError)
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The error suggests that @typed/storybook is not properly registering its render function. This could be because:

1. **Missing Renderer Registration**: @typed/storybook may need additional configuration
2. **Build Issue**: The framework might not be building/bundling correctly
3. **Version Mismatch**: Potential incompatibility between Effect/Typed versions

## Next Steps for New Agent

### 1. Debug the Renderer
Check if @typed/storybook is properly exporting its renderer:
```bash
# Look at the @typed/storybook package structure
find node_modules/@typed/storybook -name "*.js" -o -name "*.ts" | grep -E "(render|preset)"
```

### 2. Check Framework Registration
The framework needs to register properly with Storybook. Look for:
- `preset.js` or `preset.ts` in @typed/storybook
- How it exports the render function
- Whether it's compatible with Storybook 8.3.5

### 3. Potential Solutions

#### Option A: Manual Renderer Registration
You might need to manually register the renderer in `.storybook/preview.js`:
```javascript
import { render } from '@typed/storybook/render'
export const parameters = {
  // ... existing parameters
}
export { render }
```

#### Option B: Check Package.json Exports
@typed/storybook might have specific exports that need to be imported. Check:
```bash
cat node_modules/@typed/storybook/package.json | jq '.exports'
```

#### Option C: Downgrade/Upgrade Dependencies
There might be version conflicts. Current versions:
- @storybook/core: 8.3.5
- @typed/storybook: 0.9.0
- effect: 3.8.4

### 4. Alternative Approach
If @typed/storybook continues to fail, consider creating a custom Storybook framework that wraps Typed components. The key is providing a render function that:
1. Takes story args
2. Calls the component function to get an Fx
3. Sets up Effect runtime with proper services
4. Renders the Fx to the DOM

### 5. Testing Locally
Before deploying:
```bash
pnpm storybook
# Visit http://localhost:6006
# Check browser console for detailed errors
```

## File Structure
```
packages/storybook/
├── .storybook/
│   ├── main.js (using @typed/storybook framework)
│   └── preview.js (typed configuration)
├── stories/
│   ├── Button.stories.ts (converted to Typed)
│   ├── Card.stories.ts (converted to Typed)
│   ├── TypedButton.stories.ts (already Typed)
│   ├── TypedCard.stories.ts (already Typed)
│   └── CombinedButton.stories.ts (converted to Typed)
├── src/
│   └── (original storybook package files - may not be needed)
└── wrangler.jsonc (Cloudflare deployment config)
```

## Key Insights
1. @typed/storybook exists but may not be fully compatible with latest Storybook
2. The error is happening at the Storybook preview layer, not in our components
3. All components are properly typed and should work once renderer is fixed

## Commands for Quick Start
```bash
cd /Users/christopherdavid/code/openagents/packages/storybook

# Check current state
pnpm list @typed/storybook @storybook/core effect

# Run locally to debug
pnpm storybook

# Build to test
pnpm build-storybook

# Deploy (after fixing)
npx wrangler deploy
```

## Critical Warning
Do NOT deploy until the render function issue is resolved locally. The current deployment at storybook.openagents.com is working with old HTML stories - don't break it until Typed stories work locally.
