      <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mb-4">Our Vision</h2>
      <p class="text-sm mb-4">
        The future of artificial intelligence cannot belong solely to monolithic
        mega-corporations using regulatory capture and incestuous relationships
        with governments to gain power at the expense of the people. AI, like
        bitcoin, can be a liberating technology.

        <p class="text-sm mb-4">Founder & CEO</p>
        <p class="text-sm mb-4">
          Christopher has been writing software since the mid-'90s. Bitcoin
          class of '11, Nostr class of '21 and a NIP author, he previously
          founded a successful rideshare startup in Austin. From OpenAI's first
          dev day in late 2023, he saw the potential for AI agents built on
          truly open protocols with bitcoin micropayments.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm mb-4">
          Since then, he's recorded 150+ videos building in public, shipped
          multiple MVPs, and developed the vision for a decentralized agents
          marketplace running on bitcoin and Nostr. The goal: a clean mobile app
          that doubles as both Nostr client and bitcoin wallet, enabling users
          to easily interact with their own personal AI agent.

      <p class="text-sm mb-4">
        We're rapidly developing Onyx, our mobile app now in open beta for
        Android and iOS. It's a beautiful mobile application that provides
        access to a decentralized marketplace of agents, where providers are
        incentivized via bitcoin rewards to help build the best agents.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm mb-2">The app combines:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 text-sm">
